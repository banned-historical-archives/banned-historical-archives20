If this report is accurate, then the strategy of Chiang Kai-shek \"inleading the enemy up the garden path\" has receivedthe highest possible compliment. Inferentially thereport indicates that the Japanese High Command arebeginning to realize the hopelessness of their endeavour to defeat the Chinese Armies and thusachieve a decisive victory. Possibly the JapaneseGeneral hopes by his taunts to provoke GeneralChiang to play into his hands by agreeing' to a pitchedbattle, but this manoeuvre is doomed to failure.General Chiang would indeed be foolish if he allowedhimself to be \"rattled\" by the insults of the enemyand consented to abandon a plan of campaign whichhas been proved immensely successful and has converted what was expected, on all hands to be a shortwar into a long and grim struggle. It would be veryilluminating if we could obtain a correct statement ofthe losses incurred by the Japanese since the beginning of the \"incident.\" Such meagre statements asthe Japanese have released place their losses at anextremely low figure but during the progress of a warit is a common practice for the High Command tominimize their losses as much as possible for thepurpose of discouraging their opponents. In thepresent war the Japanese losses fiom diseases suchas dysentery and typhoid are believed to be considerable and when you add to these the losses in killedand wounded inflicted upon them, in, and aroundTaierchwang Hsuchowfu and the Wuhan Cities thetotal must inevitably assume serious dimensions.It anyone had compiled a record of the number ofhospital ships plying between China and Japan withtheir compliment of sick and wounded the figurewould be significant. It would not be surprising ifthe Japanese were beginning to be war-weary. Dia.appointment at the stubborn resistance maintainedby the Chinese and the growing impossibility offorcing a speedy decision may cause the Japanese tobring the war to an end much earlier than ha a hithertobeen expected. The stiffer attitude adopted by England and America and the ever-present Russianmenace are also factors which the Japanese cannotafford to ignore. The costliness of modern warisappalling and even the wealthiest nations in theworld cannot survive the constant drain on theirresources for any lengthy period. The end of the\"incident\" cannot be far distant."}]}
