Up to now tilegeneral opinion has been that the \"undeclared war\"would last for four or five years but recent eventssupply cogent reasons for a change in the prevailingopinion. Foremost among these is the Munich Conference which, by removing the danger of a WorldWar has afforded the great Powers an opportunitythey have long desired, but preoccupation with theirown ahaira engendered by the imminence of the warthreat in Europe prevented them from taking anyactive steps to bring about a conclusion of the hostilities. Second only in importance to this reason is therecent decision of the League of Nationa to applyArticle XVII of the League Covenant to the Sin6Japanese War and its condemnation of Japan as theaggressor. The effect of these two events has 'notyet been widely appreciated but it will shortly appearin an Increase of support for China as the victim, anda refusal of support to Japan as the aggressor. Thisrefusal of support to Japan may be expected tobecome effective in three ways (1) A boycott of Japanese goods. (2) Refusing to sell arms or wermaterial of any sort to Japan. (3) Refusing to giantany form of credit to Japan Although America isnot a member of the League of Nations it seemscertain that she will actively co-operate in thesemeasures. The inevitable result is that enormouspressure will be exerted on Japan to constrain her tocome to a satisfactory settlement with China. It isequally certain that China will entertain no proposalfor a settlement which infringes her Sovereignty.Can Japan disregard this Pressure? It is wellnighimpossible for her to do so, for discontinuance ofsupplies, particularly from America, will make itvirtually impracticable for hsi to prolong the war formore than a month or two. Reason and wisdomtherefore, combine to counsel the Japanese to offergenoeous peace terms now. If she does so worldopinion will favour some substantial concessionsbeing accorded to her, and China herself, at therirndelat time, may be induced to accept reasonabletmontcn however, Japan delays she will find herselffaced..by aaountry which has proved its power anddetermination to fight to the last and in addition shewill be reduced to such a desperate condition throughshortage of essential war materials that, so far fromemerging victoTioualy frorn the conflic tshe is ultimately brought to defeat."}]}
