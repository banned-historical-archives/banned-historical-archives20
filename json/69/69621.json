But the Generalissimo by his:latestproclamation shows us that he is not a man withonlyone idea, he has ordered a general offensive one halfdozen fronts and a tightening up of guerilla obstructron in all the occupied territory of China. This is astupendous undertaking and one that must cause themost acute anxiety to even the bravest Japanesecentingent, for it means no more nor less than ageneral offensive over more than 2,000 miles of countryWhich is by far the longest fighting line ever knownin the history of the world. It deals a heavy blow tothe Japanese plan which at present consists in usingtheir mechanical superiority to push forward andoccupy certain Strategic centrcs that will facilitatethe defence and exploitation of areas which they havepreviously occupied. As the position is now. everymile the apaneae. advance merely extends the longline they hold already,and increases their liability toattack by Chinese regular forces or organized guerillas at any point they care to select on the long thinline. Frankly it seems impossible for the Japanese toproceed with their, plan under such dangerous andhopeless conditions for assuredly they will realize atno far distant date that there is no hope of prosecuting the war to a successful issue under the eircumst- nces which now prevail. Heavy fighting has beenProceeding in South $hansi in thr neighbonrhood ofPaotingfu, Kaifeng, and also north-east of PeipingIn. north Honan and central Hopei serious fighting hasbees.gong on for weeks, In Kiangsu considerablelesses have been .inflicted on the Japanese accordingto some reportas from Haimen. and Nantingchow.InKwantung province the Chinese forcesare reportorted tobe gaining ground in the region of Canton. Last ofall comes a report that the Chinese under General MRChan-shan have daringly pushed their way into Manchukuo to the vicinity of Chinchow in Liaoning lithis rumour is true the Chinese are indeed turning thetables on the Japanese in a sensational manner. Aglance at the map gives one some idea of the heavystrain which is being put on the Japanese'High Command to resist attacks on sectors so widely separated.The battles now proceeding 'eonstitute'a Suficientlyserious problem and menace to Japanese Commandersbut added to /his they are troubled bY unceasinganxiety as to' where some new attack may be launchedby the Chinese at any moment. In warfare the' sidewhich possosses the initiative.has an enormous advantage. Hitherto the Japanese have enjoyed thisadvantage but under the Generaliseimo's new stablelyit seems that the ini. tiative is speedily passing to theChinese. This is a very serious matter for the Japanese and undoubtedly they will be compelled thisto undertake a drastic revision of their plebs., Thefighting during the next few months will be full ofintense interest. Much will de'pend upon' thequantity and qualitY of the military equipmentwhich General Chiang can furnish to the armiesengaged in the new offensive. If some of thesearmies are only partly 'mechanized, Japanese rag-'imente in isolated sectors are threatened' withdisaster.
