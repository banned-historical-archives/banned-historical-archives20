Theword patriotism means love of one's own country andcomes from the Latin 'petrie',which means one's owncountry. In .times of peace the spirit of patriotismgrows weak in all countries' and .this was particularlytrue of China beeausa the constant fearof disasterfrom ,famine; floods or bandits, which afflict thiscountry more than any other, naturally forced thepeople to concentrate their attention on the protection and preservation of their families and gave themless opportunity to consider the needs of the nationas a whole; When war brea! is out, and more esPecially when the war is one of invasion, devotion to one'scountry is roused to its highest pitch. The strengthand growth of this spirit of patriotism in China hasswept tway the many differences that existed inprovinces,, cities and villages, differences in politics,Mid jealousy among leaders, and has United the wholecountry into one single family passionately andresolutely determined to undergo and sacrifice ratherthan surrender the sacred soilof their beloved country, The' force Of this. patriotic sentiment may beshown by one'example: a short time ago GeneralissimoChiang Kat-shek issued'an order, that in future allcitizens whether civilians or officers must salutesoldiers who have been wounded in the .war. Thus,we now see honour paid publicly to the silnple soldierin the streets ofthe cities, and yet only a few shortyears ago, the profession of a soldier'was consideredto .be one of the lowest forms of occupations, and anyrelation who. entered it was Tegarded as refieetingvery little credit on the family. Today a family'sprouder boast ts that one of it members servingwith the tighting forces.\" By emphasisng this altorsdpifits, tit the Chinese people it is not intended toglorify war. but to call attention to that wonderfulmanifestation of the whole world. In .the past it hasbeen said that heroic devotion to China which haswon the praise and admiration of the whole world.In the past it has been said that the Chinese havelittle love for their country hut those who said so havegravely wronged a great nation. No one who has metChinese in foreign countries could fail to observe thedeeply-rooted longing ,to return to his own countrywhich has filled the heart of the Chineso exile.Patriotism indeed does not consist only in fighting topreserve the freedom of one's native land: it may beshown in other ways than by willingness to die forone's country. Principally itmay be shown by livingfor one's country. In this lies the chief importanceof the patriotism which we see like a flame sweepingthrough the whole country and lighting in everyChinese heart a blazing torch which will not be extinguished by the cessation of hostilities. The seedsof sacrifice sown on the blood-stained battlefield willyield a rich harvest in the rising generation who willlive for China. What then' is the meaning of livingfor one's country? It is public service By whom?By everyone. By the statesmen.who render uuselfishservice for the,welfare of tile country. By minorofficials and influential business men who-set themselves to stamp out injustice, fraud and 'squeeze.'By the ordinary'citizen- whose participation thoughhumble is equally important, he does his share bYfaithfully-performing his daily duties: by giving agood example, a gift which is far more valuable thanthe giver ever supposes: and by supporting loyallythose leaders Who are fighting the battle for improvement in national life. These are the rich fruitswhich wli most certainly be produced from the patriothma which animates the Chinese nation todayFom the Welter of warfare a glertfied China willgarise."}]}
