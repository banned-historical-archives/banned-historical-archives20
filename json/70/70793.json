It is only naturalthat each　side should wish to present, such a versionof the military situation as Will appear most encouraging and favdurable to its own people. In theSino-Japanese conflict there have been surprisinglyfew falsifioations of reportr uP to the present time;defeats and reverses have been admitted with a frankness which is as praiseworthy as it is unusualamong nations at war. Now however, with regard tothe. Spring offensive of the Ohinese troops there haveappeared for the first time absolutely contradictoryreports from the Headquarters of the rivat armies.The Japanese assert thai the SPring offensive is over,that the Chinese attacks have been easily repulsedwith great loss of life to the Chinese and considerablegain of ground to the Japanese in many sectors. TheChinese, on the other had claim that their Springoffensive has not begun yet and that they are stillengaged in perfecting their preparations for it. Thecontrast between these two accounts is certainlystartling and deserves the closest investigation sothat we may arrive at the true facts. That there hasalready been a considerable movement of Chinesetroops cannot be denied. During the month of Aprilengagements have been ffought on the Kiangsi front,on the Shansi front, on the Hnpeh front, on the Kwantung front, on the Hopei-Charhar front, on the Shantung front, on the Ckekiang front, on the Honan frontand on tile Suiyuang front. This has all she semblanceof fighting　on a large scale boca:use on the aboventioned fronts no less than 300 battlea were fought.Even if we allow that some of these battles were ofno great importance their numbers and the extendedarea of opmfions gtrongly suggest organisded andconcerted action hi accordance with a preconceivedplan. in that ease was id not the Sprng Offensive!At first aitfht tt would seem so but on a closer enamination of the facts it does not seem so. If thiswas in fact the offensive whivh General Ghiang Kaishek announced .that he was preparing how dash itcome about that the best Chinese'troops sad　the bestChinese Generals have taken no part iu it? If thiswere really the Spring Offensive surely General Chimngafter his public announcement would have sent hisbest troops and ablest Generals to conduct, id Thefact that he has not done this powerfully suggeststhat the engagements fought in the month of Aprilwere only a preparation for the Spring offensive,undertaken for the purpose of discovering the sectorson which the Japanese forces were weakest. so thatlater on he could break {hrough the Spring offensive.of the Japanese line with his main forces. If this bethe true explanation theti the:Spring, offensive is stillto come. The outlook for the Japanese appears extremely serious and from the point of view of militarytactics it seems wident that they will be obliged inthe near future to shorten their line considerably andto concentrate their forces on riverine and hill positions tavtics suitable for defence. If they fail to carry outthese manoeuvres in time they may find themselvesexposed to the appalling disasters of encirclementand wholesale slaughter which the English wrlterH. G. Wells prophesied in his book The, Shape ofThings to Come, which was publishedthat in the year1934. When it is remembered that the population ofChina is six times as great as that of Japan the planwhich the Japanese have set OUt tO ffulfil in the FarEast assumes proportions which are too formidable toignore. The success which has already'attended the“Spiritual Mobilizwti 0n Movement”which General Chiang launched on April 17 shows that the morate ofthe Chinese people is higher; today than it has everbeen-since the beginning,of the war. So few mietakeshave been made by the Chinese in this war and Sowise and skillful has been their conduct of the Campaign that it seems:impossible to believe that thestruggle will continue for a long time as so many people, assert. The presence of somany factrs in favour of China indicate on the contrary a glorioustermination of hostilites at a much earlier dato."}]}
