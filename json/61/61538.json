Less than a hundred years ago books werewritten by educated people for educated people andwriters took pains to express their ideas in the bestEnglish in order to exhibit their style, art and learning to the limited public which they addressed at thattime. With the spreed of education, writers soughtto capture the attention of the greatly increased butless well-educated readers that sprang into existenceand consequently books began to appear written insimple language which everybody could understand.Again as a greater number of people began to read, itbecame possible to publish books at a cheaper priceuntill nowadays the deeds and thoughts of the greatestminds of all ages are within the reach of all. Biographies, Science, Art, Romance and Adventure are allrecorded in books at a moderate price and are apowerful influence which bene fits the people of everycountry in the world. Good books are the finestteachers we can find. The knowledge and informationcontained in good books has helped many a man tocorrect wrong ideas which he had previously held andfurthermore have enabled him to improve his condition in a way which otherwise would have been impossible to him. On the other hand it is also true thatbad books likewise have a great influence and may doa man serious harm. For this reason parents andguardians have a grave responsibility to see thatdangerous books are kept away from young people.A wise parent is not only careful to keep dangerousbooks away from the young but will prevent the reading of badly written or frivolous stories for if childrenare given only well written and improving books toread. the children will develop a taste for such booksand in this way their minds will be elevated and theywill develop cultivated and refined ideas which will beextremely beneficial to them. A clever French authoronce said \"To know everything is to forgive everything.\" Imperfect understanding and false impressions are the causes of more than half the troublesin the world. Much reading enlarges the mind andgives us understanding, with understanding we learnmoderation-he middle way-the golden mean advocated by Confucius. All these advantages may begained from the reading of books, which practice wemay accordingly describe as being worthy of thegreatest encouragentent."}]}
