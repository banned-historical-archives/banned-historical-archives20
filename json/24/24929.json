It is true that in the present struggleChina possesses the sympathy of a larger number offoreign powers than Japan does, furthermore it isprobable that the combined military power of thesenations would suffice to ensure ultimate victory toChina. ft is also true that the intervention of otherrowers would afford China a measure of relief,temporarily. No one can deny the comfort enjoyedby one who is fighting singlehanded when a stalwartchampion comes to his rescue. The consequencesof a world war must, however, be considered; tobegin with, no war nowadays can be made todeclare a dividend, the costliness of modemwarfare is so colossal, that any nation which goes towar pssctically condemns itself to bankruptcy. Thehavoc caused by modern weapons of war, highexplosive shells and bombs from the air has addedenormously to the horrors of war, towns and villagesare destroyed utterly, and thousands of noncombatants, men, women and children are killedmercilessly. Such a conflict would ruin victor andvanquished alikc, it would cause miseryibeyond calculation to a world loaded down with debt, and itwould set back the progress of civilization, a hundredyears. Even If intervention should bring a Speedyand deci ive victory, the gain to China would beillusory, because she would lie under heavy obligations to her saviours which would have to be met inthe shape of special privileges. By accepting help,hoping for the intervention of one or moreburden of their conflict with Japan; but theon their side, would certainly be followed byof Japan. A world war would be the result,she would still be a bone of contention for thehungry hounds of any aggressor nation, for she wouldstill bear the fatal stigma she has borne for over acentury, of being incapable of protecting herself,.unaided. On the other hand if no interventiontakes place then China by her own courage and'endurance will have earned a glorious independence.What are the grounds of this sweeping assertion?they are in brief two-folded:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"First the stubborn resistance of the Chinese andtheir dogged determination to die rather than yieldto aggression have raised an insurmountable bsrrierto Japanese ambitions."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Secondly, Japan based her hopes on speedyvictory - in this she has definitely failed; the timefactor - the expense - the strategy of the Chinese ofavoiding direct retreats and of harassing the wings ofthe advancing Japanese armies, combine to producethis effect, that Japan to conclude this war successfullyis compelled to subjugate the whole of China - asuperhuman task. If China maintains her \"will towin\" and pursues unswervingly the same tactics thathave, so far proved successful, if she preserves herproverbial patience and endures the sacrifices andlosses inseparable from modern warfare, she will notonly survive, unaided, the present conflict, but for ageneration no other power will dare to molcA her,and if within that period she cannot complete her,reconstruction and provide adequate defence againstany aggressor she will only have herself to blame."}]}
