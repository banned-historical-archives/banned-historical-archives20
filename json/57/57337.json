Reuter's corresponds, eat has apparently collected the military, political and economic views of Government officials in Chungking and they provide very interesting reading matter. In the first place it seems to be generally agreed that it is. impossible for China and Japan to enter into direct peace negotiations, nevertheless the belief is. gaining ground 'that Japan would like to terminate the present hostilities after she has carried out one more big military push. This final push, it is predicted, will have no important strategic object but is designed to improve Japan's political position when the time arrives for the discussion of peace terms. The probability that these official opinions accurately describe the present situation appears to be confiirmed by the facts that (1) apart from minor engagements in West Shansi, West Hupeh and Southern Kwantung, generally speaking there has been no milltary development of serious importance in recent weeks and (2) the Japanese are reported to be.withdrawing troops from Hankow. Kiukiang, Shanghai, Hangchow and South China. In view of these reports it certainly looks as if Japan is considering the desirability of bringing the war in China to an end. It 'way be that these extensive withdrawals are prompted by anxiety on the part of Japan as to what is going to be done by Soviet Russia in regard to the Fisheries dispute, This dispute will inevitably reach a critical stage next month when the auctioning of the fixed fishing lots is due to commence. Japan is daily becoming more urgent in her representations to Soviet Russia that a reasonable settlement of this matter be speedily reached. Unless agreement is arrived at within.a very short space of time there is grave danger of hostilities breaking out between Russia and Japan and it is possibly because of this danger that Japan is withdrawing her troops in China in order to mass them on the Soviet border either forthe definite purpose attack or alternatively m the hope that such a demonstration of force may over. awe the Soviet and induce them to adopt a more reasonable, attitude on the Fisheries question. The growing solidarity between the great,democra tic Powers, England, France and America may-suggest to Japan that a Europan conflict is now unlikely to occur and that these Powers may at last feel free to take a far more direct interest in events in.the Fay East and that this interest may be disclosed in a manner prejudicial to Japanese hopes and intentions. Furthermore the outspoken declarations of the de. mocratic states, particularly that of America. that Japan's projected New Older for the Far East.will not be recognized nor her unilateral denunciation of the Nine Power Treaty be a_greed tO, may convince the Japanese that no useful purpose would be served by prolonging hostilities in China which are not on!y ruinously costly but also, having regard to these new circumstances, all too likely to.prove non-productive; The prospect of the conclusion of a peace satisfactory and acceptable to China has assuredly advanced in a marked manner, and the great day when abe lays down her tremendous burden cannot long be delayed. The heroic sacrifices which thc Chinese have made and the unflinching resolution they have shown in the preservation;of their territorial sovereignty have not been in vain. They have earned toe admiration.of the world and have brought about such an unification of their country as has never before been seen in all its history. This result is all the more marvellous when it is seen to have been achieved by the most peaceloving nation in the world. The sufferings which China has so bravely and:patiently endured have been unspeakably terrible; but, when the carnage and slaughter cease a harvest of exceeding richness will be reaped. From the .Scorched earth of her soil will arise a new china, strong active and united, to occupy an honoured and honourable position among the great Powers of the word and to go forward confidently to a new era of peace and prosperity."}]}
