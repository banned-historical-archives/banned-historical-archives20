And　now　at last, after postponing hisgreat speech several times he has delivered it to anexpectant world and　it is found to contain not asingle demand or claim. Considering the bold declarations he had made　previously it would not havebeen surprising if he had issued an ultimatum　toFrance but　actually apart from　a few blusteringphrases in praise of war all he has to say is that \"thecolonial problems of Italy have the names　Tunis,Djibouti and Suez. No details or particulars of whathe wants　are given so that apparently he expeotsFrance to open the discussion and to oner concessionsto Italy. He makes an insulting and unfair referenceto Czechoslovakia when he says \"I declare that whena nation having a great many men and numerous armsand arsenals offers no resistance, then that provesthat the nation was ripe for its new destiny.\" Thisdeclaration seems to mean that in his opinion Czechoslovakia deserves her sad fate but it sounds verymuch　as if Mussolini were not too pleased about it.This suspicion is strengthened by another statementcontained in his speech. \"Geographically, historically, politically and militarily the Mediterranean Seais vital space to Italy and when we say the Mediterranean we naturally include the Adriatic Sea whereItalian interests are predominant although unexclusive towards the　Slavs.\" This allusion is almostcertainly made to Trieste an important port on theAdriatic. This port before the great war belonged toAustria and by the treaty of Versailles was given toYugoslavia. Mussolini obviously fears that Germanyhaving absorbed Austria　and Czechoslovakia　mayclaim the restoration of Trieste to Austria and thussecure for herself this most valuable outlet onto theAdriatic Sea. It really looks as if Mussolini dislikedthe successful progress of his partner Hilter to theneighbourhood　of his own country.　His fears arenatural and will possibly turn out to have been wellfounded.　If Hitler proceeds, unchecked to expand tothe Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas, Italy may findherself reduced to the condition of being a vassalstate of Germany and the prospect is evidently highlydispleasing to him. It was to prevent this expansionthat Mussolini supported Mr. Chamberlain at Munich.It all goes to show that the partnership between Italyand Germany is not so solid as these totalitarianStateshave pretended. In reality their aims and objects areby no means the same, in fact some respects they areantagonistic　and　the union of the policies of thesetwo　countries may be described as a \"marriage　oconvenience\"　entered into for the purpose of bluffingthe Democracies into giving way to their threats anddemands　but not based on love for each other. If aworld war should break out in Europe, which we stillconsider unlikely, we may yet see Italy coming in onthe side of England and France just as she did in theGreat War.　In his speech Signor Mussolini praiseswar　and urges his fellowcountrymen　to arm themselves at all costs but these fiery utterances weresimply　to please the young　and militant Fascisti.How　little he really desires war may be seen from hisstatement in the same　speech, \"we consider that along period of peace is necessary for the salvation ofEuropean　civilization and its development.\" Thesewords have one　meaning and one meaning only: theymean　that Italy does not want to fight, possibly because Mussolini has no　hopes of winning but moreprobably because　he realizes that Italy's financialposition is so desperate that she could carry on a warfor only a very short time. We need not be misled byMussolini's reference to the salvation of civilizationand development, he has no humane regard or sympathy for any other country in the world exceptingonly Italy. In　this same speech he　callously andrudely declared \"If the great democracies cry over thedestruction of their most beloved creature, it is anexcellent reason not to share in their tears.\" In thewhole world I do not believe there is a living man whois so profoundly selfish as Mussolini. The once greatRoman　 Empire perished centuries ago through softness, laziness and luxury. Mussolini seeks to make theworld believe that he can revive the glories of ancientRome　by boasting and hurling insults at other countries but, pastmaster as he is at vulgar abuse, he willfind that to conquer the world　\"hot　air\" is notenough梚n　addition he will discover that it is necessary to have brave soldiers and sailors. So far thereis no evidence that he possesses these　unbeatabletroops unless we are to consider the mowing down ofdefenceless Ethiopians from　the　air as　a proof.Deeds speaks more　strongly than words. If Italiandeeds prove　to be as　\"tall\" as Italian talk thenindeed　the Italian nation will be found to be invincible. The　much-heralded　 but belated speechwhich　Signor Mussolini made　 last week　indicatesa reluctance to proceed　to deeds but　exhibits allthe　old love for　strong language, but the　finalimpression it conveys is that the people of Europemay　sleep peacefully in their beds for some timeto　come,　thanks　to the　benevolence　of　SignorMussolini."}]}
