Why is this? Principally, I think,because we lack stability. The great war upset thenervous system of mankind in general; instead oflonding steady, ordered existences we have uncertainty, anxiety, financial stringency and far moreexcitement than is good for us. The incessant strainto which we are subjected in our endeavours to preserve the little that is left to us and to enioy it withsafety and security have tended to make us abnormally selfish. This selfishness is a natural productof the times in which we live and should not occasionany surprise, nevertheless it is very necessary thatwe should realise how harmful it is to humanity andstrive to check its malign influence. How is this tobe done? By cultivating the converse of selfishness--namely consederation for others. At first sight thismight seem to offer little attraction but I assert confidently, that if each and every one of us deliberatelyset out to treat others with consideration an astonishing increase of happiness would accrue to ourselves, toour associates, and ultimately to the world at large.The difficulty is to convince a world largely composedof selfish people, that selfishness does not pay.Perhaps a concrete example will help to illustrate mypoint. A certain man was always discontented inspite of the fact that he was a partner in a very prosperous business, and in addition had a very pleasingmanner. When I asked him why he always seemedso dissatisfied he said, \"Oh well, the truth is I don'tseem to be able to make any intimate friendships.\"When I questioned him about the friends he had, Ifound that he had selected them in every case becausethey interested him, or could be useful to him. Inother words he only considered what he could get outof them; the idea of doing anything for themnever entered his head. I suggested to him that heshould take a greater interest in his fellowmen especially those, who were not so well-to-do as himself andthat he should go out of his way to be of service tothose with whom he came into close contact. Heacted on my advice in a most liberal manner, and ina few months, by his good nature and good fellowshipbecame more popular than he had ever believed itpossible for him to become, furthermore, he assuredme that he found life much more interesting nowadaysand that he had entirely lost his previous feeling ofdiscontent. Self-sacrifice, service, and considerationfor others have been advocated by the wise men of allcountries and throughout all the ages. You cannotbring even a little sunshine into the lives of others,without finding that a few rays of their happiness isreflected back on to yourself. The tendency towardsselfishness caused by the stress and strain of modernconditions must be resisted, the quickest way to restore the world to sanity and happiness is to act in accordance with the words of Confucius \"Do not do untoothers what you would not wish them to do unto you.\""}]}
