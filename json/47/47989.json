These indications are of differentcharacters and whilst it may be admitted that singlythey are not conclusive, nevertheless their cumulative effect strongly suggests the approach of peace.Firstly the Japanese must have realised by now thefuttlity of their efforts to destroy the Chinese Armieswinch today are as strong numerically as they wereat the beginning of the war and are in addition nowfighting under conditions considerably more favourable to themselves because their adversaries havebeen lured farther and farther from their base to fightover country much more easily defensible because ofits mountains and lack of rail and road communications. That is the situation and that is the backbreaking enterprise on which the Japanese areengaged--truggling over countless thousands of mileshi a desperate attempt to wipe out armies that aredefending strong positions and possess the initiativeof retiring at their own selected moment to equallystrong positions--rmies intact and still capable ofcostly resistance armies, moreover, which bitter experience has taught always succeed in effecting theirwithdrawal. Look backwards to Nanking, Hsuchowfuand Hankow; on no single occasion did the Japanesecontrive to encircle and exterminate a single ChineseArmy in spite of their vastly superior machanizedequipment. I am far from denying the bravery andgood fighting-spirit of the Japanese soldiery will gofurther and declare that no nation in the world is sofaithfully, devotedly and loyally served by the com-　mon soldier as the Emperor of Japan, but I contendthat in leadership and strategy the Japanese Army isdefinitely lacking in genius and. that for this reasontheir whole-hearted belief in the invincibility of theJapanese Army is pitifully misplaced. They aremaking an unprovoked attack on the most peaceloving nation on earth, a nation so unprepared and soutterly dificient in equipment to wage war on modernterms that they were compelled to yield the extensiveand minerally valuable territory of Manchuria totheir adversaries because their common-sense assured them that they could not hope to defend it.China is not a military power--apan assarts that hermilitary strength is unsurpassable and yet after morethan a year's strenuous endeavour she has failed tobring the peaceful Chinese to their knees as sheopenly proclaimed she could and would do in a fewmonths. The fall of the Wuhan cities was broughtabout after many months of bitter lighting and theChinese exerted a heavy toll of killed and woundedJapanese before they decided to retire and even thiscostly victory could probably nevr have been achieved without the powerful aid which was renderedto the Japanese Army by its Naval Squadrons andAir forces. One hope and one hope only, remains toJapan, namely a sudden and speedy collapse of theChinese resistance but there are no signs of such acollapse--he Japanese advance is still opposedvigorously and, more ominous still for the Japanese,the insidious attacks of guerillas are witnessed overever-increasing areas and are inflicting losses ofpersonnel and material on a scale that must becausing anxiety and misgiving in the Japanese HigherCommand. The acuteness of the financial strainovershadowing Japan is so manifest to the wholeworld that there is no need to dilate upon itutJapan cannot ignore, it--t is an ever-present terrorgnawing at her vitals. Furthermore, so far fromdiminishing, this financial embarrassment exhibitsalarming symptoms of increasing in the near future.The debate in the English House of Lords on December 7 indicated unmistakeably the growing irritationof the English people against the discrimination ofthe Japanese in the matter of trading upon the Yangtze river and in other parts of China. If economicreprisals were threatened by Great Britain alone,Japan might possibly weather the storm, though eventhat is open to grave doubt, but when coupled withthat, you hear the striking declarations of PresidentRoosevelt in North Carolina on the subject of maintaining Democracies--he knell of Japanese umbitionsis definitely sounded. President Roosevelt and Secretary Cordell Hull, prudently conscious as they areof the many Germans and Italians who have soughtand secured American nationality, have graduallybut successfully persuaded the American people that apolicy of isolation cannot be pursued in these days ofTotalitarian aggressiveness without serious danger tothe continuance of democratic processes. The President declared his firm belief in the vitality of theDemocracies and hia words which I now propose toquote afford convincing proof that he is not preparedto submit tamely to interference with the rights ofAmerican nationals; \"The future does not rest onchaace alone, nor on mere smugness nor on merefatalism but on the affirmative action which we takein America. What America does or fails to do, in thenext few years has a far greater bearing and influenceon the human race for centuries to come than mostof us here today can ever conceive.\" Such is thelatest declaration of President Roosevelt--orceful,illuminating and historic. If Japan is wise she willsee \"the writing on the wall\" and make the bestterms of peace she can with China with the leastpossible delay. The longer she hesitates to come toterms the worse her position is liable to become.There are grounds for believing that a reasonableoffer of peace, now, assuring the sovereignty of China,might find acceptance but if she persists in her desperate endeavour to bring China to her knees, thenthe outlook for the Japanese Empire is far fromenviable, and, by delaying too long she may invite toher own shores that communist menace which sheavowedly set out to obliterate."}]}
