They are four innumber: (1) Faulty Strategy. (2) Dispersal of effort.(3) Underestimating the opponent. (4) Soace. Asto the (1) the Japanese declared \"they would bringChina to her knees in three months\" and relying uponthe superiority of their military machine sent anarmy of approximately 300,000 men only to achievetheir purpose-n this I submit their strategy was atfaulty, they should have dispatched a sufficient forceto exterminate the enemy-he mere capture of important cities could not produce a speedy victoryunless it was accompanied by the destruction of theopposing forces-he Chinese armies succeeding inwithdrawing their men in orderly retreat withoutserious loss. (2) The masterly startegy of ChiangKai shek in attacking the Japanese at Shanghai. Fearof loss of face induced the Japanese to reinforce theirmarines stationed in Shanghai instead of withdrawingthem and the strenous resistance of the Chinese inthe Shanghai was upset the Japanese plan of cnmpaign, led to a dispersal of effort in two theatres ofhostilities and undoubtedly caused confusion and achange of tactics in the Japanese high Command. (3)Following the taking of Nanking the Japanese mustassuredly have expected the immediate collapse ofthe Chinese resistance-therwise they would certainly have pursed the retreating Chinese force withrelentless energy and left no stone unturned to wipethem out of existance before they could reachHankow. Thus the Japanese grossly underestimatedthe -fighting sprit and determination of their adversaries- costly blunder. (4) The protracted andbrilliant defence by the Chinese of Hsuchowfu andHankow completed by the retirement of their mainforce without serious loss dealt two heavy blows tothe Japanese because their supposedly invinciblearmy had already \"lost out on the time factor\" andworse still was engulfed in a series of military objectives involving fighting fronts, thousands of milesapart. \"Space\" is the death-blow to Japanese hopes?aggravated considerably by the \"Scorched earth\"policy. The Chinese arimes have not been destroyed,on the contrary they are probably more numeroustoday than they were at the outset of the war. Thefurther the Japanese get from the coast the moredifficult and the more costly must their effort become,added to this, the country to traversed in order tocrush their opponents is increasingly difficult to conquer and if conquered brings them no nearer to finalvictory if the Chinese as heretofore continue to withdraw in good order. The Japanese appear to haveignored this factor of \"Space ' and though they havesent over division after division in the hope of securing a decisive victory-t is too late. For the reasonsstated above I am convinced that the Japanese havenot enough time-oney-or men to bring the warin China to a successful conclusion."}]}
