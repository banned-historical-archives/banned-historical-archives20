There are many reasons for thisbelief, so many in fact that it would take up too muchspace to mention them all, but the principal ones areas follows: England and France have both definitelyabandoned their policy of appeasement arid the peopleof both nations have pledged their wholehearted support to the government. In the case of England thecolonies also have promised to back up the BritishGovernment in any action it sees fit to take. Theattitude of America has also been proclaimed in nouncertain language as being definitely hostile to thetotalitarian States; indeed America has voiced thegreatest indignation at the shameless annexation ofCzechoslovakia by Germany. Furthermore Russiahas emphatically declared her readiness to join withEngland and France in making war on Germany ifthis step should be decided on. Many smaller nationsare in addition, seeking protection against the possibility of German aggression, namely Roumania,Poland, Esthonia, Lithuania and Yugoslavia and it isextremely probable that in the early future an alliance of all these countries to stop German aggressionwill be entered into, with the possible exception ofthe United States which may be unwilling to engageformally in such an alliance in accordance with itspolicy of keeping out of European politics. HoweverAmerica will certainly give her sympathetic andfinancial support to such an alliance and will nothesitate to supply aeroplanes and munitions to thedemocratic power. The result of all these international arrangements will be that in a short timeGermany will be completely surrounded and preventedby foree of arms, if necessary, from embarking uponany further annexations. Mr. Hitler, in the past hassolemnly declared that his aim and object was toinclude only Germans and people of German originwithin the German Reich and no others. This was hisjustification for annexing the Sudeten districts ofCzechoslovakia with their 250,000 Germanic nationalsin September 1938. But there can be no excuse forhis action last week in forcibly seizing the whole ofCzechoslovakia with its population of 8,000,000 peoplewho were not of German origin or descent. It is thisshocking insincerity which has aroused the wholeworld against Mr. Hitler and Germany, and if he hasnot already regretted his ruthless action he willassuredly have bitter reason to do so in the hearfuture. The German policy of bluff and bluster hascome to an end and will not be tolerated again. Andwhat has Germany gained by it? Firstly the condemnation of almost the entire world and secondlywithin her own country she has brought herself to adesperate condition, shortage of food, shortage ofmoney and no hope of obtaining credit abread. Suchis the result of her secret re-armament, her intriguingand her breaches of faith. England previously waswilling to help her but Germany herself rendered suchassistance impossible by her deceit and unscrupulousactions. England and France do not fear Germanyas is commonly supposed. On the contrary they areconfident that as in 1918 Germany in the event of warwill be beaten a second time but, again, England andFrance have nothing to gain by such a war as it wouldinevitably result in a defeated, bankrupt Germanyturning to Communism in its desperation whilst thewhole of Europe would be weakened through loss ofmen and money and human progress and civilization set back for many years. Therefore unlessall the governments in Europe are insane, especially the Government in Germany there will be nowar in Europe at the present time."}]}
