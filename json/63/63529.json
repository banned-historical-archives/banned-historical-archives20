Tobegin with it is a breach of the agreement concludedat Munich last September between England, France,Germany and Italy and proves the insincerity of Mr.Hitler who　declared at that time that he had　nofurther territorial ambitions or intentions in Europe.That Mr. Hitler should fail to honour his obligationsis perhaps not surprising because he has alreadyshown us on several occasions that his pledges cannotbe relied upon: as a matter of fact in this newspaper,a few months ago we gave a list of Mr. Hitler's brokenpromises and　we are therefore not astonished by thisfresh; example of a breach of faith on his part. Whatis astonishing however, is that Mr. Hitler should dareto take this highhanded action. His occupation ofthe Sudetenland in September was at least excusableon account of the racial connection of the Sudeten Germans in the Czechoslovakian Republic with the peopleof Germany, but no such excuse exists in the presentcase: there is no unity of race between the Slovaksand the Germans so that Mr. Hitler's aggressive actionis unwarrantable　and　unjustified. It will now beasserted in most countries that the policy of appeasement　pursued by England　and France has proved afailure. Admittedly it has not succeeded in keepingthe totalitarian countries quiet and they are goingahead with their ambitious programmes just as if nounderstanding had been reached at Munich. Nevertheless there is much to be said for the policy ofappeasement　and the tendency to despise and sneerat it should not be encouraged. The aim and scopeof the policy is not properly understood but summedup in simple words it may be described as follows:-"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"a world war would waste millions of lives and millionsof pounds and when the colossal slaughter and damagecame　to an end they would not have settled anything.The same　international unrest, jealously and depression would still exist and in a greatly aggravated formbecause of the universal bankruptcy which such　aconflict would certainly cause. It is easy to say thatMr. Chamberlain　is weak and　credulous whilst thewanton　aggression of the Totalitarian States in freshin our minds, but hstory will probably proclaim thathis policy was wise and that it saved civilization. Iam not　so proud as to declare that the English policyis faultless mistakes and serious mistakes have beenmade, notably in pursuing the policy of disarmamenttoo far and thus leaving the country insufficientlyprepared to resist the menace of the TotalitarianStates who had got ahead of us bvssscret re-armament.But England foreign policy has always been patientand far-sighted, she haa been builiing up enormousreserves of financial strength whilst the dictators inspite of all their bluster, bullying and banging ofdrums have reduced　the financial position of theltcountries to the verge of bankruptcy. The next greatwar will be more of a battle between bankers than afight between soldiers. Aeroplanes, tanks i and military implements can　be bought and　produced inunlimited quantities if you can pay for theto and thtsis just what the Totalitarian States cannot do. In facta great deal of their existing military equipment isout-of-date and they have not enough motley to renewit. This Hitler and Mussolini know well and I amconfident that neither of them will dare to challengeEngland and France up　to the point of actual war,They will grab and plunder as much as they are ableto whilst the democracies are busy re-arming but theywill stop short of war. When the time arrives andEngland and France have adequately restored theirmilitary strength there will be a day of reckoning forthe totalitarian countries-their outrages againsthumanity and civilization will be stopped and thewrongs they have inflicted will be adjusted. The consensus of world opinion is on the side of England andFrance and that opinion in the not far distant fnturewill demand that the destinies of natidns ahall besettled by peaceful means and not by the Utrcibteaction of one power acting alone and without referenceto other nations, as has occurred just now by Germany's occupation of the Republic of Czechoslovakia-a friendly neighbouring Power-which was carried out without consulting any other country in spiteof Mr. Hitler's declaration last September that he hadno intention of incorporating within the Reieh thenationals of any other State unless there was aGerman minority within th^t State which was　thevictim of unjust treatment. Reason, justice andrespect for international obligations must be restoredand though　the outlook at present looks gloomy—the world will insist that this result shall ultimatelybe achieved."}]}
