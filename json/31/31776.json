There is an oldsaying, \"Man is born to trouble as the sparks flyupward.\" Troubles we must all of us have-we cannot avoid them, no matter how hard we try. Muchdepenas upon how we bear them. If we whine andworry about them we become a nuisance to our friendsand relations-if we brood on them and allow them toget us down we are not able to produce such goodwork as we out ht-in short we lose efficiency. If webear them bravely, however, we strengthen our characters and the experience we gain from them usuallyenables us to become more useful members of society.It pay to look on the bright side of things and toremember that, \"Every cloud has a silver lining.\"Looking back on your past life you will probably recallsome events that caused you a great deal of worryand anxiety at the tine, today you realise that thoseevents were not nearly so serious and important asyou imagined when they were upon you-many ofthem you eveb laugh about and wonder how on earthyou could have allowed yourself to be so worried.Does not that suggest that we should be wise not toworry too much about our present troubles? Theytoo will pass. and with the passage of time will turnout not to be so important. Away with dull care-the man who is forever harping on his troubles becomes a bore. \"Laugh and grow fat,\" is an old sayingand a true one-the doctors tell us that laughter hasthe effect of massaging the heart and thus greatlystrengthening its action. It also has a beneficial effecton the liver and the ductless glands. It is not oftenthat the doctors recommend such a pleasant prescription. Let us then fortify our courage with the strongmedicine of cheerfulness. Admittedly the outlook israther black just now but let us look on the bri htside. If Hankow falls, be sure it will be restored to astronger and more prosperous China. If a world waris upon us then millions of men will suffer for a time,but be sure our children will re-mould the world aftera better fashion. When bloodshed and saorifice haveswept away the mjsunderstandings and hatreds ofnations a new era will arrive of better con ditions forall mankind then peace and prosperity will take theplace of rancour and strife. Universal education andextended facilities for communication between nationscannot fail to enlighten the understanding and promote co-operation between the nations. It is then,not only our right but also our duty to look forwardand to look forward hopefully and cheerfully. \"If youwish to be happy there's a thing you must not do.Don't trouble trouble till trouble troubles you,\""}]}
