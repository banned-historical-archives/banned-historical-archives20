This right is very valuable to the Japanese Fishing industry and strong representations are being made by Tokyo to obtain a renewal of this Fishery Agreement but so far in vain. Inasmuch as the existing Agreement expires in a few days the situation between Soviet Russia and Japan in daily becoming more tense, and unless a solution of the dispute is found immediately the position may row so serious as to threaten war between these two countries. If the issue could be con iie.L at.ietly to the question of Fisrery rights, an agreement could readily be reached within a few days but Soviet Russia firmly insists on the faihlment by jap it of certain extraneous demands on a condition precedent to renewal of the Fishing Agreement. Foremost among these requirements is payment □□□□□ instalment of the purchase devicer of the　Chinese Eastern Railway the sum involved is approximately 6,000,000 Yen and is primarily a liability attaching to the Manchukuo Government. Japan asserts that this is a matter for Soviet Russia and Manchukuo to settle between themselves, but the Soviet claims that Japan guaranteed the □□□□□the□□□□□of the Chinese Eastern □□□□□uruli her to make good her guarantee. To this Japan replies \"but Manchukoan affairs have nothing to do with our Fishery rights—let us settle that urgent question first and we will deal □□□□□ with you on other outstanding questions afterwards.\"　Russia however, so far from aecepting this plan raises a further point affecting the Portsmouth Treaty and says in □□□, \"Under the Portsmouth Treaty we agreed to make a mutual arrangement with you regarding the Fisheries but this was only of □□□□□ and involved no actual obligation, but now you have broken a covenant of that Treaty by stationing a larger quota of troops in Manchuria than you are entitled to under the Treaty an □□□ your Fishery rights are based on that Treaty which you have violated we are justified in refusing to □□□□□ the Fishery Agreement.\" Japan seeks to remove this objection by declaring that the proclamation of the independence of Manchuria has created a new situation and that her military alliance with Manchukno obliges her to send additional troops to that country, for which reason, in her opinion, the Portsmouth Treaty no longer applies. But Soviet Russia is apparently unwilling to accept this view of the situation and thus matters have reached a deadlock. It is asserted in some Quarters that Russia has expressed her willingness to sign a temporary convention regarding the Fishery rights for a period of one year but Japan has already declared that she will be satisfied with nothing less than an agreement for eight years and so, Seemingly, no temporary arrangement is possible. The firm unyielding attitude whic hSoviet Russia has adopted in the couree of the negotiations suggests that she is probably actuated by other motives in her refusal to come to terms with Japan. It may be that the impending advance of the Japanese forces in Northwest China　has influenced Russian opinion because of the fact that In the event of this advance proving successful communications between Soviet Russia and China will be severed and this for political and economic reasous Russia is not disposed to tolerate without at least some attempt to create a diversion. If this view of the situation proves to be correct then the Fisheries dispute may be likened to the Changkufeng ineident and may be settled without recourse to war. That incident whilst it led to an extremely tense situation nevertheless disclosed unmistakeably that neither country desired to force the issue to the point of war. Such may　well be the outcome of the present dispute but the situation is none the less fraught with great danger. If the agreement is suffered to expire on December 28 without the conclusion of even a temporary arrangement it is probable that the Japanese fishing fleet will continue its operations in Soviet waters as bitherto, and should the Russia naval patrols in those waters oppose this action and fire upon the Japanese fishing fleet and sink a portion of it with loss of life, then national feeling in Japan may be roused to such a pitch that war cannot be avoided. The whole situation bristles with menacing possibilites which cannot, prudently, be disregarded; it reminds one of the old adage　\"that he who plays with fire should not be surprised if he gets his fingers burnt\" and unless a solution is speedily found there is serious risk that the matter may get out of hand and develop along lines never intended or desired by either party to the dispute. That either country wishes for war with the other is highly improbable for In the case of Soviet Russia the extensive purges that have taken place so recently in the Russian army strongly indicate the inadviseability of a military mobilization until more settled conditions prevail within the Army, whilst in the case of Japan her pre-occupation in China renders it exceedingly unlikely that she will willingly commit herself to any additional activity of a military character. It is impossible for the matter to remain in abeyance, so that we may confidently expect a definite decision withing a few days."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"本文有部分文字因原报纸不清晰或损坏，故以白框代替。"}]}
