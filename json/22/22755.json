upon a careful taking of stock.This serves a double purpose,it indicates those lines which haveproved profitable in the past year and it provides valuable guide as to the lines which are most likely to prove successful in the ensuing year,So it is with nations and so it is todaywith Chian at this critical phase of her history.Ayear has passed since the incident at Lukouchiao on July 7th 1937 initiated in the North of China the Sino-Japanese hostilities which have spread with the fastness and fury of a forest fire from the end of thecountry to the other.Calamitous events on an unprecedented scale have reached and tortured thecivilian as well as the military inhabitants of thecountry.No useful purpose would be servde by a recapitulation of the tragic series of events that haveoccurred during the past twelve months-they arestill fresh in our minds.This review is intendedto serve not indeed as a plen for sympathy but as a challenge to embark with revolution and hope uponthe second year of the conflict.Let us,then,studycalmly the effects and consequences of the operations up to date,so that we may profit during the ensuing year from the singificant tacts which emerge,First the time factor.On September 8,1937 thespokesman of the Japanese war Office made the following statement."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"\"Within two months China will be　 decisively crushed\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"This declaration was nodjust a chance remark,it was made deliberately and it had to be madebecause of the gravity of the economic situation inJapan because such an assurance was necessary inorder to enlist the support and agreement of the Japanese people to the prosecution of the war.The military party which at that time held the predominance of political power in Japan were obliged to promise a speedy victory and substantial economicgains in order to secure an adequate allotment fromthe budget for the prosecution of the war .if at thattime there had been the slightest suspicion that theChinese incident would involve a protracted campaign,the requisite finance,if granted at all,wouldhave been granted grudgingly and the war wouldnot have been \"popular\"in Japan.Stupendousefforts were made by the combined naval,militaryand air forces of Japan to make good the declarationof their spokesman.Remorstlessly their overwhelming superiority in the mechanical adjunets ofmodern warfare was exploited to the full in the hopeof crushing the stubborn defenders of the soil ofChina Ruthless bombing of cities decimated thecivilian population by thousands.No stone was leftunturned in the endeavour to break down the moraleof the Chinese in the hope of inducing them tocapitulate.the result proved utterly and entirelycontrary to Japanese expectations.Even the mostpeace loving citizens-even the most disgruntledindividuals-even those parties and factions whichhitherto had been bitterly opposed to the existingregime rose as one men and rallied round theadministration of Chiand Kai Shek and pledgedtheir loyal support to the Covernment.Thisunification and solidarity of all persons and parties inthe country is the salient feature of all the events ofthe past year.It is of inestimable benefit,bothimmediate and prospective to the nation and from itfar-reaching comsequences must inevitably follow.This it was that Sun Yat Sen in the San Min ChuIand in his spceches strove so hard to inculcate.\"A Chinese\"he declared\"may not care about theextermination of his country nor about who is goingto be his Emperer,since he has to pay taxes all thesame.But if there was a question of esterminatinghis clam,then,for fear that ancestral contiunity ofblood and sacrifice be broken,he could not helpgoing to fight even at the peril of his life.Let us usethese small foundation of ancestry to build up astrong nation.Suppose China has four hundredclans;it will be as if we were working with fourhundred individuals.In the name of the same clanlet us first group together the people of one village,of one town;then enlarge the group till it includesthe people of one province,or even the wholecountry.Each family name will thus become a verylarge and united body.For instance if we unite allthese who bear the name of Chen within a villagewithin a town,and within a province,then byusing their original organization as a basis,in twoor three years,I think,the Chen clan will becomea very large association…Then we shall inform thosefamily associations that grave misfortunes are threatening then,that their death hour is approachingand that they must unite in order to form the stillgreater national association of the Chinese Republic.\"Faithful to this doctrine Chiang Kai Shek haslaboured incessantly to promote the unification ofChina and now we behold this unification broughtabout in the space of one year as a result of themerciless methods adopted by the Japanese,whichhave constrained the Chinese to unite for the sakeof their preservation,of all the bitter pills whichJapan has had to swallow during the past year this,indeed,must be the most bitter."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Reverthing once more to the time factor,timedoes not flow along its irrevocable with the samefateful sequence for each of the protagonists.For theChinese tine is a matter of secondary importancebut for the Japanese the ticking of the clock is full offoreboding;for them it means dwindling finances,loss of military prestige and the possbility of disorder in their own country.In the realm of politics,too,a point arises which is worthy of consideration-the ruthless methods employed by the Japanesein this war have cost them and lost to Japan thegoodwill of many nations previously friendly to her.Superimposed upon all the other troubles whichJapan has brought upon herself is the tremendousdrain on her war-chest a considerable loss oftreasure which must cause her serious reflection.The upshot of the year's campaign indicates that ithas proved a costly adventure on the part of JapanIn Caesar's time the Romans,which faced with anup-hill struggle used to say \"Sursum corde\"-\"Liftup your heats\".The English today make use ofa similar expression\"Are we downhearted?\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"A purview of the year's events inclines us tothink that the Chinese may be offered freedom ofchoice between these two
