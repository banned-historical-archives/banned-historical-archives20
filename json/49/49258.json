Bymany it is considered to mean the increase inhuman knowledge and power, arising from themodem inventions of scientific investigators, byothers it is considered to mean the increased comfortsand luxuries that have been introduced into our livesas a result of recent improvements in the realm offood, medicine and methods of amusement. But insober truth civilization is not so constituted: its truemeaning is, \"an advanced stage in social development\" or progress in the harmonious association ofhuman beings fostered and rendered more fruitful bygood-will and co-operation in ameliorating the conditions not only of themselves but of others also.Dazzling and marvellous are the results of suchmodern scientific inventions as Electricity, Aviation,Wireless, Cinematography, together with the enormous strides made in machinery and also in medicalscience-Bacteriology and Surgery-nevertheless thehumiliating fact remains that humanity has notbenefited from these marvels as it should have done;on the contrary there is less peace of mind, contentment and happiness in the world today than therewas before the advent of the epoch-making discoveries. What then are the causes of these disappointing results? I think the cause is to be found in thelightning-like rapidity with which these inventionshave burst upon the world. Consider for a momentthat the world has been jogging along for thousandsof years marked by scarcely perceptible advances andoccasionally set back by definite declines and thenwithin the short space of 100 years all the inventionsmentioned above have sprung into existence withbewildering suddenness. The sequence was too rapidfor the world and brouzhtabout a condition of nervousexcitement which prevented what should have beena gradual and peaceful development of their usefulness. What was far more deplorable was the destructive use to which mankind in its lust for gain putsuch inventions as Aeroplanes, High Explosives andChemical Gases, and these malign purposes werestimulated a hundred-fold by the outbreak of theGreat War in the year 1914. In the train of the GreatWar there followed a period of world depression whichalso still continues, and this depression was not confined to trade which would have been a natural consequence of the loss of treasure suffered by thosenations which took part in the war but it extended toworld-wide mental depression which was far moreinjurious to the progress of civilization because itmanifested itself in a feeling of insecurity, restlessness and mutual distrust. Even so the failure ofcivilization to march forward cannot be said to havebeen satisfactorily explaine I because history informsus only too clearly that in ages long past periods ofadvanced civilization have been seen to decline andfade away. In Egypt, in Greece, in Rome and even inChina such declines in civilization have been witnessed. Mighty Empires renowned for their science,art and learning have nourished and then fallen intodecay. What is the underlying reason for these periodical collapses of civilization? They can be attributed undoubtedly to three persisting failings ofmankind, namely, selfshness, greed and lust for power.These are the evils which have marred the advanceof civilization throughout the centuries, but they arehuman failings and their fatal recurrence gives riseto the suspicion that they are incurable. The factthat up till now they have not been cured is no proofthat they cannot yet be cured. In past ages millionsof men have died from diseases, considered incurable.which today can easily be cured- is it not true, however, that in those past ages the same diseases wereuniversally regarded as incurable? It is all a question of the treatment which must be administered inthe case of curing bodily ailments and may not thesame hold good for the cure of human frailties? Unquestionably there are solid grounds for hoping thathuman failings may be cured today by a treatmentunknown in the past, just as bodily ailments havebeen cured, which in the past were regarded as incurable. What then are the social remedies availabletoday which were non-existent in the past? They arethe Cinema and wireless telegraphy used with enlightrnment for the social education of all nations.By these means it is possible to bring the nations intothe closest understanding of each other, and understanding of another's point of view is the surest wayto remove distrust and animosity. For example,what did the Chinese know about foreigners 100 yearsago, and what did the foreigners know about theChinese? What strange and weird ideas did we thenhave about each other which have now completelydisappeared. The swiftness with which communications can be transmitted from one country to another,nowadays, is causing a revolution in men's ideas.Let us suppose that the most learned men of allnations were to broadcast to the world daily lectureson the subject of co-operation and mutual assistancewith practical explanations as to the best means, (1)of achieving this and (2) of avoiding unnecessaryfriction- let us suppose that at the same time theleading film companies of the world were giving uaeducational pictures for the purpose of improvingsocial conditions and instructing us as to the methodswhereby the standard of living might be generallyimproved. There is nothing impossible about thispolitical economists today assure us that the worldabounds in all that we need for our reasonable support and comfort and that if the products of the worldwere used in an enlightened manner there would beiio need for any of us to work for more than half a daydaily. In the past nations have been busily engagedin trying to get the better of each other, if they expended only half that energy in working togetherharmoniously for their mutual benefit the future ofcivilization would be assured and the darkness ofignorance which has checked its rightful progreaswould be finally dispelled."}]}
