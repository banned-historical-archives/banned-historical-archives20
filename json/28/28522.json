It seems，therefore，that Russia will play for time in order toenable the reconstituted government and the reconditioned Army to settle down，To embarkupon a serious campaign in the middle of aprocess of transition would be hazardous in theextreme. Gravely concerned，therefore，asRussia undoubtedly is by the prodigious developments of the China incident it is improbable thatshe will contemplate the taking of any steps tomark her resentment until，at the earliestthe Spring of　1939."}]}
