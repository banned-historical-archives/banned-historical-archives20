So earlyin 1880, the German minority inBohemia appealed for the constitution of an enclosed Germanstate within Bohemia, but this theCzechs resolutely opposed. Thereason for this bitter opposition onthe part of the Czechs was the ?asamein 1880 as it is today and the reasonthen as now, was? mainly geographical, in other words the Germanminority resided for, the most partin cloae proximity to Germany andthe granting of independence tothem involved the handing over tothem of the frontier betweenCxecho-SIovakia and Germany, anobviouily dangerous procedure inview of their sympathetic attachmentto Germany. It will thus be seenthat the dispute between the Germanminority And the Czechs is? of longstanding but two additional factorshave inflamed it to an intensity addbitterness that imperil the peace ofthe world. The first of these is? thefact that when the Czecho-SlovakianRepublic was formed in 1920 following the Great war, the representstives of the German minoritydeclared that they had nevercomented to the creation of theRepublic and that the incorporationof the German-speaking regions inthe new state constituted a violationof the right of nations to Self-determination. They followed this upby continued antagoniirn to the newregime. They blamed the Czechsfor the new constitution from which,they asterfed they had been excluded. They seem however, tooverlook the fact that their exclusionfrom the national assembly whichfixed the constitution was due totheir own refusal to participate indrawing It up. The second factorwas the adherence or the Germanminority to the Nazl movement ofwhich their leader, Konrad Henleinis an active exponent. The principal complaint of the SudetenGermans-the German minority today-is that they are not given theirfair share of official positions underthe Cxecho-Slovakian governmentand, while this is true the fact mustnot be lost sight of that it is scarcelyreasonable to expect the governmentto give official positions to representives who have shown pensistentantagonism to the Government andhave even in many cases Advocatedopen rebellion. Lord Runcimanwho has gone to Prugue to act asArbitrator in the　dispute is confronted with difficulties which seemto be almost insurmountable. Solutions that have been put forward upto now appear hopeless uponexamination. The exorbitant claimsof the Sudetens cannot be reconciledWith the interetta of the Republic ofCzecho-Slovikia. For?yexample, togrant the Sudetens autonomy wouldbe tantamount to handing overthe country's natural frontier toGermany. To creats a State withinthe State would only intensify theanti-Slavic attitude of the Sudetensand Would not be fair to the Slavminorities in the German regions ofthe State. The political aims of thedisputants are utterly opposed toeach other, briefly, the Sudetenspresent the Naxi system whilat theCzechs seek to retain their status ofin independent state by treaties withFrance and Russia as a protectionagainst German aggression. It willbe seen therefore, that the aims andabject of the two parties differ towidely as to offer little of no hopeof a favourable settlement. Whatthen is to be done? It would seemthat the only podble?osolution mightbe found by a generous betowal uponthe Sudetens of good official appointments in the judiciary, the postalservice; the civil service and otherdepartments of the Government.An attempt at conciliation on theselines has already been made and ifit is continued on sufficiently generous lines holds out some hope ofsuccess, since there is reason tobelieve that Germany is not prepared to face a world war atthe present time and confrequentlywould bring pressure to bear on theSudetens to accept the settlementand modify their claim."}]}
