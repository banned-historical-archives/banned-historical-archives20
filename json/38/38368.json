The second reason isthe cutting off of communications and supplies fromHankow by severance of the Canton-Kowloon Railway,whlch constitutes the main source of supplies for theChinese armies. To these two reasons a third sboul1probftbly be added, one of a political nature, namelyto isolate Chiang Kai-shek and deprive him of supportfrom the South in the hope that the South will waverin their elle iance to the Generalissimo and thus bringabout that collapse of his regime which the Japanesehave sought so strenuously to effect. Let us nowconsider these reasons in order. (1) the diverting ofChinese troops from the defence of Hankow; this doesnot seem likely to occur, since it has been repentellystated that the number of recruits enlisted and trainedin the vicinity of Hankow exceels one million, furthermore the Generalissimo and General Wu Te Chen(whose efficiency we can vouch for fro;n experienceof his ability when he held the offi e of Mayor ofGreater Shanghai are both exceptionally rood organisers and if is inconcbivable that they have failedto foresee the present emer ency and to provideadeqoatelv for the defeoce of Kwantung, more especially having regard to the fact that an invasion in theSuuth by the Jaoanese has been expected for manymonths. (2 The cutting of the Canton-KowloonRailway and consequent interference with the mainsource of surplies this is indeal a serious menacebut the effectiveness of the threat depends upon twofactors: the number and qua ity of the Chinese forcesavoilable for the task of resisting the. Incursion on theone hind, and on the other the number of mechanizedunits landed by the Japanese. If the Japanese havelanded only a comparatively small number of menwithout heavy guns and their normal. quota of mechanized accessories, relying upon the surpries tocause dismay, conusion and dislocation of the plansof the Chinese Hi her Command, then thev may fndthemselves committed to an enterprise which will callfor reinforcements, and gradually develop into largeacale operations.ã€€3 The hope that tbe South willWuver in their allegiance to the Chiang Kai-shekrerime: there are very strong grounds for believingthat the South so lar from wavering in their allegiancewill disclose a resolute determination to fight to theleat man in defence of their province. Two causes--t is surmised--all sgur thalr relsolrnon--he associations of Dr. Sun Yat Sen with the Sou th will rousetheir national spirit to preserve the Repubtic whichhe founded, and secondly the remorseless bombingto which Canton and many other parts of Kwantunghave been subjected has fired the resentment of theSouthern atmies and may cause then to welcome theopportunity of hitting, back against the nation whichhas inflicted so much misery and si-ffering agoa theirwomen and children no less than ui on themselves.What will be the outcome of this new venture it isimpossible to pre ict when so many vital facts arestill uuKnown as to the quantity and qualify of theforces opposing eoch other in Kwantung but one thin'ii reasonably certain, that the Chinese cannot ligbtlyallow the Canton-Kowloon railway commuriicationsto be severed, and most protect this main artery ofsupplies with all the force they can possioly rally.The Japanese may accordin lv experience a vastlystiffer resistance than they expectelandinthatcasethey will fnd themselves committed to major operations which will involve a dangerous increase-In thelent tb of their lines of communication.
