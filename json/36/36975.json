To begin with itis necessary to recognize the great importance ofCzechoslovakia not merely as a powerful nation, militarily and industrially but principally because of itsstrategic position, which makes it a pivotal point inCentra? Europe. If Germany wishes to expand, hernatural line of expansion is towards the Danubianbelt but Czechoslovakia effectively blocks her progress in this direction. From the political viewpointthe central situation of Czechoslovakia is of stillgreater importance. If there is to be war on the continent of Europe the protagonists will be found toconsist, almost certainly of two groups: on the oneband Germany, Austria (now an integral part of Germany) Italy Hungary and Bulgaria: on the other handFrance, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Rumania and Russia. A Glance at the map of Europe willsuffice toinoicate the tremendous strategic importance of Czechoslovakia, sandwiched as she is right inthe centre and providing a vital link between Franceand Russia. Which side Poland would support cannotbe predicted with anything lige the same certainty,since in making her choice she would have to base herdecision upon such factors as natural sympathies,desire to link her fortunes with the ultimate victorsand fear of being overwhelmed on one or other of herexposed frontiers before her allies could give hersupport. She might wish to adopt a neutral attitudebut this she wouli find extremely difficult to maintain. The foregoing refers only to the continent ofEurope: England, of course, would at once take sideswith France if Germany were the aggressor. As matters 'stand the ignition of a single spark in one of theBalkan states is capable of causing such a conflagration from one end of Europe to the other as will, whenit has fnally burnt itself out leave only the ashes ofcivilization behind. If there is to be a fight it will bea fight to a finish, and if it is to be a fight to a finishthen it is &amp; moral certainly that both sides will suffersuch loss and damage as to make victory illusory.Some people seem disposed to think that in the eventof war the two opposing groups would be evenly matched\" those, who think this, are inclined to considerwarfare only in terms of aeroplaneg and mechanical"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"armaments, but they overlook a factor which stillplays a decisive part in war and that is naval power.In this respect Germany is in an immeasurably weakerposition than she enjoyed before the year 1914 whenshe possessed a High Seas Fleet capable of challenging the naval supremacy of Great Britain- todayshe possesses no such fleet and this fact should notbe ignored. The German High Command would, Ibelieve be the first to admit that the principal causeof their defeat in the Great War was the encirclementof Germany which prevented them from importingfood and essential raw materials. This encircling ofGermany was possible because Great Britain heldcommand of the Sea, and the same grave danger wouldface Germany again in a second World War. Twoweeks ago, the world recoiled in horrorfrom the imminent prospect of war and even to-day in most ofthe capital cities of fie world there are many peoplewho believe that war has merely been staved off temporarily but cannot be averted for long. If they areright then international statesmanship is indeedbankrupt- if millions of lives are to be sacrificed, assacrificed they would be, such a sacrifice wouldprove--not which si le was in the right--ut that ourvaunted civilization was an empty boast. In one wayand in one way only, can the maintenance of worldpeace be reasonably secured and that is by Americaabandoning her policy of isolation and declaring unequivocally her determination to oppose by force ofarms any nation that refuses to settle its disputewith any- other nation by negotiation. It would ofcourse, be no easy matter for America to abandon hertraditional policy of isolation for it must always beremembered that included in American nationalitythere are many thousands of nationalized Germans,Italians, Russians, Anglo Saxons, Scandinavians andmany others and it is obviously extremely difficultto weld so many citizens of widely oivergent sympathies into one homogeneous whole. President Roosevelt and Mr. Cordell Hull, the American Secretary ofState have gone as far as they could in boldly proclaiming their views in regard to disarmament, respectfor treaties and settlement of international disputesby negotiation. These weighty pronouncements arepotent weapons for the preservation of peace andprove conclusively——lthough no proof is necessary?that America, in spite of her isolation policy is secondto none' in seeking to promote international goodwilland harmonious cooperation."}]}
