He then put forward his proposition in some such words as these, \"Why should wegive Henry Ford millions of pounds for making motorcars for us? Thousands of us want motor cars, let usmake them for ourselves and thus save the pro fit thatHenry Ford makes. If you will give me 20 U.S. dollarsevery month for two years I will give each one of youa motor car at the end of the two years.\" Manythousands of people answered this advertisement, andsent the clever advertiser their 20 dollars every monthbut at the end of the two years they did not get theirmotor cars: the advertiser was a swindler and he ranaway with all their subscriptions. Nevertheless, hisplan was a good one and if he had been more honesteveryone could .have had his motor car and wouldhave got it at a cheap price. Even a swindler cansometimes teach us a valuable lesson. The Germangovernment heard about this swindle and thoughtthat if the idea were to be developed honestly thescheme would work out very advantageously for theGerman people. Accordingly the Government gavethe matter its closest attention and constructed afactory at Fallerslet en in Germany and arrangementswere made for turning out thousands of cars of asound but simple design. The German people werethen invited to purchase these cars by monthly instalments. The response was immediate and alreadymore than 150,000 Germans have placed orders for a\"Volkswagon\" or People's car. The new car will besmall and cheap but it will be solidly constructed ofgood lasting materials. It will possess one entirelynew feature, namely an engine at the back of the car.For some years, designers of motor-cars have recommended the adoption of a rear-engine and haveadvanced strong reasons in support of the alteration;but motor car manufacturers, whilst impressed withthe belief that the rear-engine would be an improvement on the present design do not dare to make theexperiment because they are affraid that their customers might be unwilling to buy the new car, preferring to stick to the oldfashioned design to whichthey have grown accustomed. The German government has had the boldness to adopt the new design,advocated by the scientific motor car designers andall the indications go to show that their bravery willbe richly rewarded. The German people, more thanany other people, like to be told what they should doby their government and we confidently predict thatthe people's car will be a tremendous success andthat it will not only prove a source of revenue to theStale but also of such benefit to the people that othercountries will hasten to fellow Germany's enterprisingexample."}]}
