The American Noteof October 6 contained a reasoned protest against thediscriminatory policy adopted by japan against therights and privileges of American nationals engagingin trade in China. The American note which wascouched in polite but firm language called attentionto Japan's infractions of her Treaty obligations anddemanded a cessation of the practices objected to andthat for the future Japan should abide by her solemnundertakings and should respect in every way therights of Americans to pursue their legitimate tradeoperations in this country without interference andwithout discrimination. The reply which Japan hasnow made cannot be considered as in any way answering America's protests and complaints. In substance it amounts to a weak plea of justification ofher infringements on the ground that conditions inChina have altered radically and that the treatiesreferred to by America are out-of-date and should nolonger apply. Japan advances this plea for America'ssympathy and understanding of her difficulties insupremely persuasive notes but the plea is manifestlyunsound for two reasons: (1) If conditions are alteredin China it is the Japanese, and the Japanese alone,who are responsible for the altered conditions so thatall their difficulties in carrying out their Treaty obligations have been about by their own conduct and thusdo not constitute a valid excuse. (2) If the Treatiesare out-of-date that fact does not justify them intearing them up, treating them as \"Scraps of paper\"and doing what they like. If they honestly belive theTreaties are no longer applicable their only propercourse would be to convene a conference of the signatories to the treaties for the purpose of agreeingupon such revisions of the Treaties as seemed justand reasonable to the signatory Powers. But Japanarrogates to herself the right of abandoning the treaties for her own advantage and to the prejudice of theother signatories which is an obvious breach of international law. Hitherto Japan has studiously cultivated American goodwill as was shown by her hurriedapology for the \"Panay\" incident and her payment ofcousensation: by so doing she showed excellent judgement-by rejecting the American note, as she has nowdone, she has _iot only definitely and dangerouslyantagonized America, she has laid herself open todisastrous reprisals. Unquestionably America willregard the Japanese reply as a challenge and will meetthe refusal of her just demands by economic reprisals.Before she acts she may possibly, and even probablysend one more note to Japan to afford the latter anopportunity of correcting her mistake and muchdepends upon Japan's decision then. If Japan persistsin rejecting the American demands her outlook isextremely grave: for ahe needs America desperately,both for the acquisition of essential supplies and as amarket for her silk products. If these two fail, theresult will be far-reaching and will imperial the wholestructure of the Japanese Empire."}]}
