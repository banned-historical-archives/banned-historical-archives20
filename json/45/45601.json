This gesture was eminentlysuccessful and after the conference at Munich of representatives of England, France, Germany and Italy itseemed that the war-clouds had been happily dispelled.With the exception of a mere handful of discordantvoices, felicitations and congratulations poured in onMr. Chamberlain from all parts of Europe and alsofrom America and it looked then as if alt danger of aworlds-wide conflagration could be confidently, dismissed from men's minds for the space of at least ayear or two. To-day the prospect has no such roseatehue and yet It la not possible to lay one's finger onany particular item of news and say that there isdisclosed a likely cause of war. It is the cumulativeeffect of a number of events that ia disquieting. Thereis an old English saying \"A straw will show whichway the wind is blowing:\" since the Munich conference many straws have been blown along by astormy wind that seems to indicate that the possibility of a world-war in the near future is not so remoteas it is generaly considered to be. These may be setout briefly as follows:-Germany expressed surpriseand dissatisfaction at the rearmament plans, of England and. France which were actively put in handimmediately following the peaceful conclusion of theMunich Conference. Perhaps Mr Hitler hoped thatthese two nations would continue to carry on In -astate of unpreparedness because he had consented tohold bis hand for the time being. But England andFrence were not so obliging-doubtless they felt thatthe Berlin, Rome, Tokyo axis had advanced with suchunexpectedly powerful strides that steps must betaken to preclude its further progress, The excessivereprisals undertaken by the German governmentagainst the whole of the Jewish community becauseof the assassination of a German diplomat by a Jewishyouth in Paris, shocked the civilized world andaroused acute resentment which has found publicutterance, particularly, in England and America. Thishas caused intense annoyance to Mr. Hitler and ha aundoubtedly impaired the improved relations whichbad begun to disclose themselves between the Democratic and the Totalitarian States. Minor portents ofwar-like significance are Signer Mussolini's delay incoming to an amicable agreement with France, al.though the latter has cordially' extended both herhands to Italy as a .token of her desire to establishmore friendly relation between the two nations.From Barcelona, in Spain, comes the news that in themiddle of October, Germany and Italy supplied GeneralFranco with a substantial reinforcement of war-planesand accessories at a time when the European nationswere being urged to take concerted action to expeditethe termination of the war in Spain. Reports fromWashington indicate that Germany has delivered an"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"unsatisfactory reply to the States Department's request that Germany should assume responsibility forthe payment of Austrian bonds held .be the UnitedStates. The American representations also Includedrequests for payment of U.S. $24.086,708 which isowed to the United States for grain and flour purchases In 1920 and also a substantial amount owed toprivate American interests holding Austrian bonds.Germany has taken over Austria but her hesitation Intaking over Austria's-obligations is a disquieting sign.Considered singly the points enumerated .above maynot seem to have much weight but their combinedeffect indicates unmistakeably .that there is a lack ofthat better understanding between European nations: which we were led to expect after the Munich conference. The danger of war in Europe is patentlymanifest from the various alliances and pacts whichdivide the nations info two camps-democratic andtotalitarian, each struggling for supremacy. Thesituation bears a painful similarity to that whichprevailed before the Great War, with Germany Austriaand Italy allied against England France and Russiathe same uncertainty prevails to-day as to the sidewhich Italy would espouse in the event of an outbreak of hostilities. Signer Mussolini is far tooshrewd to comit his country definitely to support ofGermany, unless Germany by dramatic success in theinitial stages of the war could demonitrate that ultimate victory would be certain. The undoubtedweakness of Germany and Italy, economically, is, astrong argument In favour of peace. They know thatib the event of war they will encounter a stubbornand prolonged resistance-bitter experience in theGreat War has taught them this lesson and the rejoicings of the populace in Germany at the peacefuloutcomes of the Munich Conference shows, that thelesson has not been forgotten. There is anotherpossiblity In which many shrewd internatioaal observers believe, namely, that Hitler has no intentionof going to war under any circumstances bat, is merely\"dressing bis shop window,\" with a brght arry ofmilitary splendour and is content to reap ttie Benefitof all the concessions made to him as a result of histhreatening demeanour by nations anxious to savecivilization from the ravages of a war surpassing inhorror all previous wars. To conclude on a hopefulnot the all-round reduction in tarids which will certainly follow the satisfactory conclusion of the AngloAmerican trade pact will make it possible for everynation to engage in more trade and on a mote advantageous basis. Any easing of the economic tensionso acutely prevalent in the world to-day cannotã€€failto engender ,a corresponding easing of the politicalstrain. A peaceful solution of the world's troubles isin sight but there still exists a grave danger that thetotalitarian states may smash it now by a gambler'sthrow, to wit, a desperate effort to win worlddominion before the Democratic Nations have hadtime to put there house in order from a militarypoint of view"}]}
