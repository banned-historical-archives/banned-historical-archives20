During the past years theworld has witnessed a munber of brutal acts of aggression but none have sur passed in brutality thelatest exemple afforded by Italy's unprovked attackon Albania one week ago　Apart from the injusticelnflicted on the Albanian nation this move on the partor Italy has no great pllitical significance so far asthe democratic Powers are concerned. Actually itseems that Italy's motive was based on a desire togein control of the Albanian ports before her totalitarian partner Germany had a chance to open a valuable \"window\" onto　the Adriatic Sea　The axis isnot so strong that Italy could view with equanimitythe appearance of the German flag in any port of theAdriatic which would constitute a challenge to Italiansupremacy in that Sea. Signs are not wanting thatItaly views with distinct misgiving Germany's expansion towards zones which are vital to her own securlty. In tructh Italy finds herself in a serious dilemma.Her support of Germany is　beneflcial to her providedGermany　attacks France or Russia but if Germandesigns are centred on absorbing the Balkan States.Italy is faced with two prospects, neither of which isattractive to her. In the first case she may find herself involved in a　European war and lose it in which event her　downfall will be complete or in the secondcase if Germany and Italy did manage to win the war,case if Germany and Italy did manage to win the awr,the time would speedily arrive when for all her sacrifices and risks, Italy instead of reaping the fruits of victory would wake up to discover that　she had　merely become a vassal State of Germany.　\"It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good\" and certainly the Albanian outrage has yielded one useful resultl; it has finally and completely convinced the whole world that the word of either Hitler or Mussolini can not be believed. The pathetic frust which some statesmen placed in the pledges of theese two dictators has disappeared entirely and forever,and　as a result agreements are hastily being conclude among Europeannatiens to　ensure mutual protection against any further aggression on the pare of the totalitarian states Although the situation in Europe is admittedly grave I　am　still strongly of the opinion that a　world war will not　break out in the near futrre. I am　well awaro that many poople consider this confident　 opinion　of mine to be misplaced but nevert he lessIadhere to it for this reason. The consequences of waron a large scale would be appalling and would causeincalculable suffering and ruin in Europe no matterwhich side won. The democracies assuredly willcontinue to work for the pressrvation of peace andprogress unless some further act of aggression whichvitally affects the balance of power in Europe com.pels them to take up arms. Will the totalitarianStates, then, make a bid for dominion in Europe? Itis plssible if Hitler is utterly insane and can drag hiscountry into agreeing to the fatal advenlure,　but it is not probable and even Mr. Hitler must have　 somesane advisers to convince him how slender would be his chances of success. His policy of blun and blackmail has been highly successful but it has been easyhitherto because of the determination of the sanernations to avert at all costs a war which would de stroy civilization and prog ress. But even a child　cansee that that policy has been　played out and that any　attempt to pursue it further will inevitably cause aconflagration. What then? If Germany provokes warshe will be opposed by England, France and half adozen other European nations. Germany and Italyhave reserves of ammunition which will only sufficefor a short war whilst her opponents will not onlypossess superior reserves within their own territoriesbut are assured of ujlimited supplies of munitions ofwar from Soviet Russia and the United States ofAmerica. Under these circumstances what hope ofvictory can Germany and Italy have?　 Italy, the sanerpartner of the totalitarian combine no doubt realisesthis to the full and will doubtless call a halt to herambitious schemes when war is seriously threatened.Hitler　I expect is　equally well aware of the uncertainty of support from Italy if he pushes matters to exrtemes and thereford he dare no start the troublefor fear of being left to face the music aione.　He isthus forced to wait until Italy precipitates the crisis　because he can then support ber once she　is definitelycommitted and　no longed able to withdraw.　But as this is just what Mussolini is too shrewd to　do,　thepossibility of war is most　unlikely, so that whilst the suspense adn uncertainty may　continue for many months before a　settlement of the situation is finallyreached, it is iniprobable that war in Europe willbeeak out."}]}
