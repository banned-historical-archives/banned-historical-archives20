Thosewho made implements of stone,such as axes andapears or fashioned out of clay domestic articles suchas pots and vases would exchange their handiworkfor the skins of animals or the produce of the earth.The obvious drawback to this system was the difficulty of arriving at a fair exchange. The difference invalue between horses,cows and asses could be adjusted by the addition of axes or vases but only if thetrader needed an axe or a vase,consequently thetransaction of business was far from being a simplematter. This was the system of barter which ourforefathers used for centuries until its unsatisfactoryfeatures stirred their ingenuity to adopt the use oftokens and coins to regulate the price of commodities. Gradually the token system developed to theuse of paper money based on credit until it reachedits present stage where banknotes,cheques,bills ofexchange,and promissory notes permit the transaction of business not only between man and man butalso between one country and another. Gold was thebasis of this admirable system of international creditbut the Great War exhausted the reserves of gold heldby the national banks of most nations and gravelyinterfered with the trade of those countries,who bylosing their gold had lost their credit and thus wereno longer in a position to exchange their surpluscommodities with other countries. This was badenough but the position was seriously aggravated bythe crushing tariff barriers which foreign countrieserected against the importation of goods from othercountries. The world-wide depression,proverty andinternational bitterness now prevailing is due mainlyto this restriction of trade caused by inability toobtain foreign credit or to surmount the obstacle ofhigh tariff walls. To this problem there is only onesolution:to go back to the barter system which possesses the priceless merit that it is entirely independent of foreign exchange or tariffs. Thus we are facedwith the strange spectacle of the collapse of ourcomplicated financial exchange system which is oneof the marvels of eivilization and the forced resumption of methods employed in primitive times by barbarians. Strange as the contrast it is neverthelessimmensely beneficial to the world and more than anyother measure is calculated to bring the world back topeace and prosperity. Senator Byrnes of the UnitedStates,with the approval of President Roosevelt hasadvocated the making of barter agreements with England, Holland, and Belgium for the exchange ofAmerican wheat and cotton for tin and rubber, thesupplies of which are controlled by these three countries. The mutual exchange of the surplus suppliesof these nations will not only facilitate the transaction of business amounting to millions of pounds invalue but in addition will have far-reaching consequences. The ability to dispose of surplus suppliesis in itself a great gain to the countries conserned butthe gain does not stop there, added to it is the immense saving of gold reserves which would otherwisehave to be handed over to secure these necessarycommo lities. The gold thus saved can be utilized topromote trade in other commodities with other countries. The system has already been used by thetotalitarian States to their great advantage and itsextension by degrees to every country will result insuch a flood of universal commercial activity thatthe existing depression will entirely disappear, thestandard of living will improve all over the world anda new era of prosperity and progress will be usheredin. Expansion of this scheme may even lead ultimately to the adoption of universal Free Trade whichGreat Britain has advocated for so many years. Theobjection to Free Trade hitherto has been that thesmaller nations have been unable to compete withthe big nations. As a result of barter agreements itmay be possible to grant the smaller nations a monopoly or partial monopoly in the sale abroad of ce-taincommodities and thus make it possible for everycountry to enjoy the benefits of Free Trade. FreeTrade means natural trade instead of artificial pricesand if its universal introduction should be broughtabout by reverting to the primitive system of barterit will be an extraordinary event and one that willpromote world progress more greatly than anything clse that has happened in the past thousandyears."}]}
