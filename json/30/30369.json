Of the Democratic nations, the two mostvitally concerned for the preservation of peace areEngland and France but a third doughty champion ofdemocracy__america__shows every sign of throwingoverboard her long-cherished policy of disentangle_ment from European politics and with a far-seeingrealization of the trend of international affairs isvoicing in no uncertain manner her firm resolve tooppose energetically any would-be disturbers of thepeace. The recent agitation of the Sudetens in Czechoslovakia with its attendant danger of German intervention in support of the Sudten demands createda first-class crisis and seriously menaced the maintenance of world peace. In the realm of democracyEngland and America stand for ideals whilat Franceassumes the role of the practical exponent of democracy. England and America are working for thecomity of nations and are indefatigable in their effortsto promote harmonious cooperation with and betweeaall countries. France on the other hand whilst justas anxious for peace as England or America seems tome to view the problem of the preservation of peacefrom a more realistic angle and to deal with eachsituation as it arises mainly only insofar as it affectsher own immediate interests. First and foremost inthe mind of every Frenchman is the fixed determination nevey to suffer afain an invasion of her soil bythe Germans. Yet the possibility of such an invasionlooms large today and one would have expected thatmagnificent spirit, which the French exhibited sopre-eminently at Verdun, to have expressed itself farmore vocally during the recent crisis. Instead wefind France seriously pre-occupicd with her own domestic problems. In this another instance of Nerofiddling while Rome is burning? Decidely not theFrench are far too practical a people to be guilty ofsuch folly. In truth the explanation is to be foundin the fact that the problem with which they aregrappling__the 40 Hour week__is itself a practicalissue of outstanding importance. This question is ofgreat interest to the whole world and not to Francealone, so that a brief description of the history of theaffair merits consideration. In the year 1936 thepolitical party then in power---known as the \"PopularFront,\" introduced legislation to improve the lot ofthe working man: the two lost important Items of thenew law were, that no workman should be called on towork for more than 40 hours per week and secondly,that there should be an all round increase of workmen's wages of approximately 15 per cent. This increase was subsequently raised to 35 per cent becausethe cost of living had risen, since the passing of thelaw, to such an extent as to necessitate this furtherincrease in wages. The limitation of the workinghours of a workman to 40 a week had three specificobjects. First, it was expected to reduce the numberof unemployed and. in this respect it was definitelysuccessful. Secondly, it was deal ned to allow theworker a reasonable amount of leisure so that bemight improve himself physicilly and intellectuallyand lastly, it was expected to increase the purchasingpower of the people and thus promote the country'seconomic recovery. In actual practice, the purchasing power of the people his only slightly Increasedmainly because of the increase in the cost of living,whilst the position of employers has been severelydamaged by the reduction of working hours and theincrease in wages- in lead accordings to Pertinax__oneof the shrewdest commentators on French Affairs theburden of the employer has been increased by 80 percent. In fact the trade of France has been so badlyinjured as a result of these laws that the question oftheir re-examination and probable revision has had tocome up for immediate consideration by the FrenchParliament. Naturally, bitter opposition will be offered by representatives of the Radical-Socialistparty, the International Socialist party and the Communist party in France who will not lightly forego theadvantages they have derived from the laws underdiscussion. This question is of enthralling and vitalinterest to the workers of every nation and is worthyof the closest consideration--it is a practical questionand the French as an eminently practical nation arewell qualified to deliberate upon it wisely. Mostunfortunately the matter has arisen at a time whenthe whole eaerfty anrt force of the nation is ur- entlyneeded to assist in preserving the peace of the world,which is in serious jeopardy. Party politics arc ofabsorbing interest to politicians all the world over: theFrench just now are confronted with two politicalproblems and it is greatly to be hoped that the excitements of political partisanship will not confuse theirminds as to the relative importance of these twoquestions, What France needs today and what allher well-wishers would wish her to obtain is a strongCabinet with sufficient authority and prestige to putan end to all internal dissensions and to unite thewhole nation at toil critical stage other history."}]}
