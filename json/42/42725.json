The vigorous advance of theJapanese, with has already progressed far beyondHankow, though ao far it has been successful, exposesthe long thin line of the invaders to considerable riskof being cut oft from their base. The retreating defenders of Chinese soil also have grave difficultiesand c'angers to overcome in pursuing their policy of\"Scorched Earth.\" To conduct an orderly retreatan. at the same time maintain adequate food suppliesfor the retreating forces is a task calling for organizing ability of a high order. Unquestionably, amonghis generals Chiang Kai-shek numbers some brilliantstrategists but these men are exceptional and it ianot possible for them to organize effective arrangements for all the Chinese armies extended in vastnumbers over a large front and widely separated fromeach other. A great deal therefore depends upon theinitiative, the enterprise and the efficiency of individual Commanders and last but not least, their abilityto co-operate. An eloquent tribute to the existenceof this ability to co-operate is cited by Mr. Jack Beldenin the Shanghai Evening Post of November 8 wherehe praises unreservedly the manner in which theCommanders of the 4th Army and of the 52nd Armycollaborated with signal bravery and success in thedefence of the road from Hsingtze to Tehan. Ifsimilar willingness to co-operate is forth-coming fromother Commanders then the attempt to \"bring Chinato her knees\" can never be accomplished. The mostimperative duty of thft National Government to-dayis to encourage, promote and cement this spirite ofco-operation. Too frequently in past wars--ot onlyin China--e have seen campaigns lost because ofthe iealousy of Army Commanders or through theirselfish refusal to collaborate arising from a desire togain individual fame by their own unaided efforts:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"rather than share the glory with another General theydeliberately endanger the success of the whole enterprise. The value and importance of organizationcannot be over-emphasized. An outstanding instanceof the truth of this assertion was furnished by theBoer War at the beginning of this century; for morethan a year the British suffered reverse after reversefrom the Boers, then Lord Kitchener was sent out toSouth Africa and by his able organization of supplieshe speedily brought about a complete change in thefortunes of the British who thereafter progressedsteadily and successfully to victory.
