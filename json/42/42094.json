Theprofligate waste caused by war cannot be reckoned interms of money: in addition to the loss of treasurerepresented toy the war debts, there is the indirectloss involved in the ruin or restriction of many ordinary businesses and furthermore the loss of life of aserious proportion of the flower of a nation's manhoodwhose potential earnings for the state are lost throughdeath or disability. Most of the troubles from whichthe world is suffering today are due to the strugglesof impoverished nations to recover from the effects ofthe wastage of the Great War. To make good theirlosses they are obliged to expand their trade and inthe tight for markets for that trade we see a fratricidalerection of tariff barriers accompanied by ruinouslyunsettling fluctuations of national currencies. .If allthe nations could afford to adopt Free Trade tomorrow,seven tenths of the real reasons for war would immediately disappear. Will anyone seriously challengethe assertion that one of the main aims of Japan inwaging wnr with China at the present time is to consolidate her trade position in the Chinese markets?For twenty years a ruthless contest for markets hasbeen carried on by the nations with little hope ofabatement or possibility of relief. But, at last thedark-hued clouds of international animosities arebeginning to show a silver lining. The ray of sunshineto which I refer is the negotiations which are nowtaking place between Great Britain and the UnitedStates for the drawing up of a trade agreement between these two countries. The obiect of this agreement is the removal of the restrictions against tradebetween these two nations by lowering the tariffbarriers which hitherto have hampered and hinderedtheir free commerical intercourse and, scarcely lessimportant, have impaired the friendly relations, whichought, and otherwise would exist between these two.great English-speaking countries. At this point thequestion may well be asked, \"Where do I come in?thia may be all very fine for Great Britain and Americabut what benifits will it bring to any other country?\"The benefits to be expected are considerable and farreaching. The economic getting-together of GreatBritain and the United States will speedily and immensely increase the prosperity of both of them-thelowering of tariffs and the application of the mostfavoured nation principle will inevitably induce othercountries to make similar concessions, with the resultthat an all-round reduction of tariffs will ensue andthe artificial barriers which for so long have crippledinternational trade will gradually disappear and a newera of universal prosperity will be ushered in. Thecrushing tariffs under which the world has labouredso long have been the principal cause of the widespread unrest from which we have all been sufferingTariff walls between nations make trade difficult andexpensive-naturally therefore the breaking down ofthese walls will render trade more easy and lesscostly, and once trade becomes less costly it willfollow that a country can afford to do a larger tradeand thus ultimately, greater wealth will flow into thenational coffers and contentment be restored to aharassed world. Already an accord between Canadaand the United States is being negotiated-a happyaugury for the conclusion of similar internationalagreements. The ball has started rolling, and provided its progress is not checked there is no reasonwhy it should not slide smoothly down the roughmountain-side of international rivalry and come torest in the happy valley of universal good-will andwell-being. Moreover, the negotiations between England and America have a wider significance than issuggested by a purely economic understanding: improved mutual relations in the realm of trade willundoubtedly result in improved mutual relations inthe realm of politics. Concord between these twogreat democracies would provide the most powerfulguarantee imaginable for the preservation of worldpeace. It would be highly deplorable if anythingshould impede the patient investigations for a satisfactory agreement that have been proceeding steadilybetween the two countries: patience and perseveranceare essential: the issues at stake are of far reachingimportance, they cannot and should not be rushed.Too great haste to conclude a successful agreementwould probably end in defeating its own object for anunworkable or one-sided arrangement would fatallyinterfere with the sequence of similarly satisfactoryagreements on the part of ether countries whichwould follow as a matter of course if the agreementbetween the two original promoters were seen tooperate smoothly. Unquestionably Great Britain andthe United States are fully alive to the vast possibilities of the great transactions in which they areengaged and from this it may legitimately be inferredthat their attitude will not be confined to seeking onlytheir own self-interest, but. that the magnitude of thematter will inspire magnanimity in their breasts andpave the way for a happier day for suffering humanity."}]}
