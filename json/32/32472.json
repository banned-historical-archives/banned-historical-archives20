How, then, does it comeabout that there are so many millionsof unemployed and destitute peoplewhen the necessaries of life areaccessible to all in abundance onsuch easy terms? The reason is tobe found in the failure of the nationsto co-operate as they could and shouldco-operate to their enormous advantage. Indeed so far from co-operating the nations are engaged infratricidal competition with eachother. Instead of peace and plenty wehave wars and rumours of wars.Why? because the world is sufferingfrom shock-the shock of the GreatWar. Just as the shock of a seriousaccident frequently induces in thevictim a feeling of exessive fear, sothe horrors of the Great War haveinduced in the nations a great fear.Fear of attack, fear of poverty.Fear is the ailment of the worldto-day, and the world is dangerouslyill. The remedy for this deadlydisease, this corroding fear, is certainly not to be found in the mannerso far disastrously attemped, namely,by waiting for the opportunity tospring at the throat of a weakernation or by unfair means to wrest amarket for TRADE from a nationtoo weak to defend itself. Make nomistake about it - most war are wagedfor Trade - do not allow yourself tobe misled by the utterances oforatorical statesmen whose task it isto incite their nationals to war byspecious invocation of the nationalhonour which they call upon themloyally to preserve, thus, covertlycamouflaging their real objectiveTRADE, from the simple folk whoseinnate sense of decency would forbidthe waging of war for such sordidpurpose."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"It would appear then, that thespirit of friendly co-operation whichis essential to the world's wellbeingis not forthcoming. Whose fault isthis? It is useless to seek to apportion the blame, undoubtedly somenations are more guilty than othersbat no useful purpose would beserved by complaints, complaintswould only lead to the bandying ofcharges and countercharges andwould achieve no satifactory result.It is no good grumbling at a sickchild. The naions are sick-it isbetter to recognise the fact and seewhat can be done to restore themto health. Three things are necessaryunderstanding confidence and cooperation. As to the first the Frenchhave a saying, \"to know all is toforgive all,\" Most quarrels are theresult of misunderstanding. If youare willing and patient enough todiscover the other man's point ofview you will generally find that hehas just as much right on his side asyou have.　Understanding then iathe first requisite and in these daysof rapid and easy communicationbetween nations there should be nodifficulty in establishing it. But itwill not come by wishing, it must beworked for, in other words theremust be organised effort to promote jinternational understanding. Conversely no nation should consent togo to war unless and until the truemotive and purpose of the proposedwar has been thoroughly disclosed.Ultimately there will be a worldcourt to adjudicate upon such issues,but id the meantime we can do ourbit by using our votes and ourvoices to compel enlightened argument in preference to brutal recourseto force.　 The second requisite,Confidences, presents more difficuly.To bring this about propaganda innecessary and the propagandistsmust be sincere and devoted, notselfseeken nor motivated by theinterest and advantage of theirown countries solely. There is noshortage of people with　thesequalifications they are known butused. Under existing conditionsthey hold aloof from the sordidatmosphere of polices, but givena genuine mandate from the peoplethey will emerge and render loyalservice. Confindence between nationsis deliberately blocked by thevicious machinations of armament-makers, whose injurious activitiesare not sufficiently understood.These public pests have their ownpress, their own agents and affiliationsin every government and their aim isto prevent understanding betweennations, worse still, to promotemisunderstandings and to incite towar in order to reap prodigiousprofits from the sale of their pernicius products. In this connexionthere is a salutary measure that thepeople of every nation should inriston, namely the enforcement of aregulation that every statesman orgovernment official found to be ashareholder or in any way associatedwith a firm of armament makersshould immediately forfeit his position. This is a practical step thatcould and should be taken to curbthe malevolent enterprise of armament manufacturers, who for filthylucre are sellingthe cause of humanity.The last requisite for the restorationto health of the nations is, co-operation, and this is the most difficult ofall.　 The enemy here is, BIGMONEY, in other words the bigfinanciers of the world, who manipulate governments, policy, and thecurrencies of the world from London,Paris, New York, Berlin and othercapi'al cities of the world - thesemen know the value of co-operationand use it to the limit and therebyreap collossal fortunes at the expenseof the public. Money talks and thepower wielded by these financierscontrols governments and can makeor break the ordinary businessmanat　pleasure.　 Their power isadmittedly stupendous, but it can becountered and centered successfully.How? by man power and willpower.　After all they are in aminority - you and 1 and thelongsuffering peopir of the worldare in an overwhelming majority,and our will can and shall prevail,if we have the grit and determinationto　 succeed.　 People　are　toolethargic, they listen spellboundto the words of their statesmen andhumbly swallow the manufacturednews instilled into them by astutepropagandists."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Wake up, rise, organise, cemeto be led by the nose demand thetruth insist on honest officials andrefuse positively and definitely totolerate any official who is actuatedby selfinterest. Too long, we havebeen passive like sheep, we must beup and doing. We can succeed,because we have on our side twodecitive factors, superiority of number and superiority of ideals.Curiously enough the instrumentwhich may unite the nations of theworld in understanding, confidence,and co-operation is the cinema,harnessed to the cause of humanityfor peace and prosperity of the world."}]}
