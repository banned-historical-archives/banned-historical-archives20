Possibly one man　and one man　only,c ould answer this question with certainty to-day andthat man　is Reicha Fuehrer Hitler his responsibilityis a grave one for if he decides to plun; e Germany intowar　and Germany　fails to win, then the fate of thatgreat nation is sealed, How will he decide? Wherewar　is concerned prophecy is always dangerous, butthere are　two factors which in my　 opinion pointstron' ly to the fact that a world war in the near futureis improbable. The first point is based on the factthat, in and wars, and most especially all modern warsthe element of surprise and sudden swift and devastating attack is of the highest importance. This isparticularly true in the present crisis: ensure successit ia essential for Germany to overwhelm Czechoslovakia quickly and　decisively by which I mean thatshe must　achieve this task within two months or atthe most　three months, so that she may consolidateher　position there am possess　herself of the rawmaterials and food which Czechoslovakia has in abundance, before France and England can rally to therescue.　To my mind it is highly si niucant that Germany　has consented to take no action untill October2 and has allowed Czechoslovakia that interval of timein which　to decide whether to accept or refuse theGerman　terms. By　so doing she has at the same timegiven Czechoslovakia a chance to mobilize and prepare for war, if war is to be the outcome. The frontiers of Czechoslovakia are extremely mountainousand I find it hard to believe that Germany woul' allowany　opportunity of increasing their impre nability ifshe really intended war. Germany may, of course begambling on a short war but 1 hardly think so, becausethe Great War of 1914 to 1918, the Spanish War, andthe 'Sino-Japanese hostilities all clearly indicate thata modern　war is necessarily a long war, If there isone thing that Germany cannot afford to give to heropponents　it ia time, for her greatest danger is ashortage of raw materials and food of which she lacksreserves. Unless she could remove this danger by aspeedy conquest of Czechoslovakia her position wouldbe perlious in the extreme. By giving time Germanyin my judgement　indicates and intention to securewhat　advantages she can fop the Sudetens and forherself by negotiation without recourse to war Possible also she is delaying a declaration of war untillher defences on the Rhine have been completed, fearing invasion by the French. The second significantfact that points to peace rather than war is the actionof Italy. If the stage was set for a great conflictbetween　the Dictator States and the Democracies onewould expect　Mussolini to be breathing fire and murder. On　the contrary he is strangely guarded in hisutterances梚s obviously seeking to promote peacen I has　not even mobilized his army　 Although,therefore, Europe is like an armed camp and the situation ia fraught with dander, a consideration of theabove facts inclines one to the opinion that there willbe no world war in the immediate future."}]}
