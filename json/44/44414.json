Thatthe possession of money gives tremendous powercannot be disputed, in many ways it is regrettablethat more money should command this immense influence but the fact that it does so is incontestable.In war, no less than in peace the long p.urse oftenproves a decisive factor and the financial coaditionsof the leading nations of the world may profitably beconsidered because of the bearing they may have onthe ultimate result of the Sino-Japanese hostilities.Beginning therefore with the two countries mostdirectly concerned it appears that the expense of thewar for China is greatly reduced for two reasons, (1)She is fighting on a shortenen line and thus savea theheavy cost of transporting men, guns. ammunitionand food supplies over long distances. (2) She isfighting on her own ground and can therefore secureall the natural products of the country at the leastpossible expense. On the other hand the position ofJapan is exactly the reverse of this, she is fighting ona greatly lengthened front and is compelled to transport her men, armaments and supplies over thousandsof miles whilst the territory which she gp in's furnishesher with little or no sustenance because of the\"scorched earth\" policy which the Chinese consistently maintain. It must also be remembered that theJapanese rely greatly upon mechanized armamentswhich the Chinese do not possess to anything like thesame extent, but mechanized units whilst being definitely effective are nevertheless exceedingly expensive and taking all these facts into consideration, it isprobably no exaggeration to say that the war to-dayis costing Japan at least four times as much money asit is costing China. The disparity in daily expenditure is significant for it means that Japan's financialresources are being strained four times as heavily asChina's. Every single day that the war is prolongedthe .-financial position of Japan becomes progressivelyweakened. Unless, therefore she can speedily \"bringChina to he knees\" or patch up an acceptable peaceshe may find herself so impoverished as to be unableeven to reap the spoils of the territory she ha? alreadygained, in which event any further extension of thehostilities, however, victorious it might be, would notimprove her general position. So long as China continues to fight, her position is far from being desperate: success on the battlefield is not everythingand every day that passes makes it more difficult forJapan to achieve success. Henceforth the- fightingwill take place in mountainous country, and thefarther she goes the greater is the danger that Japan'slong thin line may be encircled at any spot selected"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"&gt;y the Chinese for \"staging a com-back.\" With the"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"passage of time both China and Japan will becomeincreasingly dependent upon foreign countries forfinancial aid and credit, but with very different prospects of securing this assistance. The fact that theLeague of Nations has declared Japan to be the Aggressor definitely places Japan at a disadvantage andpromises financial aid to China from member nationsof the League and very probably from America also.From now on FINANCE is destined to play an increasingly important part in the war in China and hereagain the dice are heavily loaded against Japan: hernatural allies, Germany and Italy are in no positionto furnish her with adequate financial credits even ifthey were inclined to do so, indeed they can be underno delusion: faced as they are by the prodigious armament programes of England and France they willundoubtedly husband their financial resources fortheir own needs and will have nothing to spare fortheir Oriental ally. From the point of view of financial aid China will find herself with the Wealthiestnations in the world ranged on her side. The financialresources of the British Empire梕normous Gold reseryes of France梠ne of the most thrifty countries inthe world梐fford scope for financial assistance on acolossal scale, and it is daily becoming more certainthat America too will be forthcoming with substantialfinancial support, since Japan's infringement of the\"Open Door\" policy in China has provoked keen resentment in the United States and that resentmenthas been openly exhressed by America on severaloccasions. It would seem, therefore that Financemay yet prove a vital determining factor in the issueof the present war. To an overwhelming degree Chinahas gained the sympathy of foreign powers whichJapan has correspondingly lost and this loss cannotbe ignored or regarded as insignificant, already inAmerica it has led to the discontinuance of the purchase and supply of certain commodities from and toJapan and any further curtailment is fraught withconsiderable danger to Japan financially. So long asJapan can maintain her trade with foreign powers shecan, to that, extent, offset the payments in gold sheis obliged to make to those countries for essential warmaterials, but increasing failure to find customers forher products in foreign countries will compel her todraw more and more heavily upon her dwindlingreserves of gold. Exhaustion of gold reserves isthe deadly meaance with which Japan is faced.for in such a case she has to fear not only nationalbankruptcy but also her inveterate foe.
