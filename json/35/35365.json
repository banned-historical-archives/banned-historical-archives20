It will therefore, Ihope, interest the reader if I furnish a few details ofHitler's character and career, and lest you shouldthink that these also may be inaccurate I will state atonce that theyare given on the authority of the wellknown writer Mr. John Gunther, who has made aSpecial study of the moat prominent men of the dayin Europe and has embodied his opinions in a bookof exceptional interest called, “INSIDE EUROPE.”Many people imagine that Hitler is a man who hasworked his way up in the world from beginnings ofextreme poverty-such is not the case-his fatherwaa an inspector of customs who had married a moderately .ricb woman: this lady died, And shortly afterwards Hitler's father married again. His second wifedied a year later and after an interval of three monthsonly, he married a distant cousin named Clara Poelzlthis was ttie mother of Adolf Hitler, who was bornfour years after the marriage on April 20, 1889.Hitler was born in Austria and both his parents wereAustrian and he himself was an Austrian until he wasover 30 years of age; as a matter of fact he did notfind it at all easy to acquire German nationality because the Reich government at that time feared theNazis and were not disposed to confer the status ofGerman nationality upon the leader of that movement.In order to secure nationalization it was necessaryfor Hitler to hold a government position: citizenshipwould follow automatically it he could become a German Official. With this object in view，Dr. Frick, whowas minister of Education in Thuringia and an ardentbeliever in, H,itls,r decided to appoint him Commanderof Gendarmerie in. the small and unimportant town ofHildbarghauaen, Unforturtately for Hitler the newsleaked out aittd the whole of Germany laughed so muchat the picture of Hitler as a Hildburghausen policeman that Dr. Frick was obliged to give up his plan.Subsequently another Nazi who held the position ofminister of Justice ia Brunswick appoiated HitterCounsellor of tne Brunswick Legation in Beriift. Although very few people in Germany knew that sucha post existed-it was enough for Hitler's purpose, hetook the oath of loyalty to the constitution-which hewas openly pledged to destroy-and thus became atlast a German. The term Nazi. the official name ofthe party under Hitler, has puzzled many people; theexplanation is simple, the word \"Nazi\" is the shortened title of the National Sozialististische DeutscheArbeiter Partie (the National Socialist German Worker's Party.) The personality of Hitler is remarkableand most uncommon. By nature he is intensely passionate and it is this innate fire in the man that hasenabled him to sway huge audiences and has mostcontributed to his success, yet in his private life he ismost moderate- he does not drink, smoke, or cultivatethe society of women. He has never married nor hashis name ever been linked with that of any woman.The pleasures of the table do not tempt him-he livesmost frugally-he has no desire for riches. His appetites, his love, and his life is centred in, and devotedto his adopted country-Germany. Surprisingly he isa bad speaker, illogical, lacking in graceful style andoften hysterical in manner. It is his fiery eloquence,his singleness of purpose and his determination thatmake him so formidable. His sole and whole ambitionis to create a strong national Germany. Curiouslyenough he hates to make up his mind; his orders areoften vague and contradictory: the reason is thatHitler relies and has always relied upon his intuitiona dangerous policy for a man and still more dangerousfor a leader, but it must be admitted hi3 intuition hasgenerally proved to be right and at several criticalstages of his career be has staked his reputation aadhis cause upon bis intuition, even against the adviceof his most loyal supporters, and it has never let himdown. In one thing he is intensely human-his passionate love of music. A strange man and a complexcharacter: with millions of worshipping admirers butscarcely any intimate friends' if Hitler had used histalents for religen instead of statecraft he would havebeen an eminently successful priest, his monastichabits and oratorical gifts eminently fitting him forthe priesthood. In point of fact, however，he haselected to consecrate his life to the State-so far wemust admit, with beneficial results to Germany but inthe future can be, and will he continue to be successful? His rise to power has been meteoric and so perchance may be his fall. The qualities he possesses Welike a two-edged sword to make or break his country."}]}
