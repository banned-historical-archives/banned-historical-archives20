Furthermore the purges which haverecently taken place in Russia indicate that all is notas well as it might be at home, so that Stalin mayjudge the present moment as inopportune for intervention. In Tokyo the prospect of war, now,with Russia can offer very little attraction. TheRussian defences along the Amur river arebelievedto be extremely strong and could not easily be penetrated but the factor which will weigh most heavilywith Tokyo is the Russian Far Eastern Air Fleet,which is in perilous proximity to the shores of Japanand capable of striking a swift and deadly blow thatmight go far towards paralysing Japan's militaryactivities.Japan therefore has little to gain but muchto lose by challenging Russia at the present time."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"A sane consideration of all the circumstancessurrounding the Changkufeng border dispute leadsone to conclude that neither Russia nor Japan willdeem it politic to force the issue to the point of war."}]}
