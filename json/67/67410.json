M. Edwards,"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"SOME months ago I gave a list in this newspaperof the solemn promises which Mr. Hitler hadbroken and I pointed out that his lies were sogross that no reliance could be placed on his word inthe future. As prophesied, his lying has steadilycontinued but his latest effort has so shocked the world that even the most simple and trusting nationswill never believe him again. I refer to his brutalseizure of Czechoslovakia in spite of solemn undertakings previously given that Germany would neverbring the people of any other nation under the Yokeof the Reich unless they were of the German race.It is this crowning breach of faith that has roused somany nations in Europe tO unite in a pact of resistante against any further repetition of aggression onhis part. These liues are written net to \"weep overthe milk that has been spilt\" but to expose the systematic character of Mr. Hitler's lies. In every casethe procedure is the same before perpetrating thecrime of aggression. He first solemnly declares hehas no intention of doing any such thing, secondly hestrikes with lightning rapidity and commits the crime,thirdly in order to strifie the protests of the outragedWorld he declares that he had to do it because othernations areseeking to strangle Germany and consequently he had to do it in selfdefence. In actual factof course, no nation is threatening Germany andGermany herself is the only disturber of the peace.This system of barefaced deceit is invariably followedby Mr. Hitler and each of tile three staples r any betraced in all his acts Of aggression. Before embarking upon a fresh crime he usually declares that theprevious effort was his last and that hehaa no moresurprises in store nor any further territorial ambitions for Germany. That the responsible leader of agreat nation can persistently dishonour his pledgedword is deplorable enough but the mischief does notstop there. No newspaper or in individual in GermanyIs permitted to criticize the Fuehrer, any adversecriticism brings immediate imprisorment and brutalflogging and the German jails are crowdedwith Germans who have dared even to whislper a suggestion against ihe autocratic ruler. Evens suspicion of criticism will land a man in jail, and parents are condemned because of the unguarded betrayals off their opinions disclosed by their own children/ To such depths of degradationhas civilization sunk in Germany today under the ruthless regime of the Nazi Government, When one considers the many eminent men that Germany has produced and the admirable qualifies which so many Germanns possess it is a tragic spectacle to ace the fair name of the German nation constantly besmirched by the deceit and untruthfulness of its leader. Perhaps the worst feature of Mr. Hitler's policy of lying is the: fact that for a hundred years faith-in treaties and in international undertakings will be shattered and nations will be obliged to waste their sorely needed treasure in extensive armaments for defence because it will no longer be' safe to place any reliance on solemn pledges. This wasteful expenditure on armaments will fatally retard human progress--will reduce the standard of living in practically every country and lessen the comforts and happiness that would be avai!abe for man's eno joyment if the national revenues were not to be diverted from peaceful objects to military preparedness. The prospects of progress for the rising generation are far from roseate: we seem fated to live under the sh'adow of wars and turnouts of war rather than in the sunshine of fraternal co-operation between States. Even so we should be wrong to despond. Education and enlightenment on a more universal scale may in a few years effect a radical change in human conditions. At this very moment there may be youths growing to maturity who will guide afflicted humanity by leadership of a higher quality than we have hitherto been privileged to receive. A few'such wen, by radio broadcasts might speedily convert anxious kingdoms into gardensof Paradise. No man has Uved in vain who holds aloft the flag of high ideals."}]}
