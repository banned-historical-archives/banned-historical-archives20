His speech is of'transcending interest to the whole worldbecame it indicates an intention on the part of America to abandon hertraditional policy of holding aloof from the disputes of other nations.Hitherto the avowed policy of the U,$.A, has been to keep out of aworld war at all costa unless her national interests were directly affected orher national honour involved. This departure from her traditional policymarks the beginning of n new era in international relations and is actuatedby n realization o! the fact that an iniury to any nation reacts iniurioustyupon every other nation-to quote Mr. Cordell Hull'0 own words, \"Eachday's developments make more and more clear the fact that our ownsituation is profoundly affected by what happens elsewhere in tke world.Whatever may be our own wi0hes and hopes, we cannot, when there istrouble elsewhere expect to remain unaffected. When destruction, is.poverishment and starvation afflict other areas, we cannot, no matterhow bard we try, escape impairmentof our own economic well.being.When freedom is destroyed overincressing areas elsewhere, our idealsof individual liberty, our molteherished political and social instutions are jeopardied.\" It is amatter of regret that this realizationon the part at the U.S.A. has comeso late, for if 20 years ago she hadappreciated the inter.reaction ofnational events as she appreciates itto-day she would have backed upthe League of Nations with the fullforce of her undoubted power andinfluence and many tribulationssuffered in the interim by the world,hereself included, might have beenavertnd. However what is the goodof deploring the past when there isso much to be done to-day to provide for the future. Mr. Gordell Hulldeclares that America wants peace,security, progreas and prosperity.\"Our practical problem\" he states,\"is that of finding the best methods ofkeeping our eyes and our feet uponthe better way of co-operating withother nations that are seeking as weare to proceed along that way.\"This policy is expounded as if itwere a new idea, whereas in fact itis only an amplification of whatEngland has been advocating for:many years. Mr. Cord,-ll Hull, is,perhaps stealing England's thunderbut England will not mind, on thecontrary, she will rejoice to welcomeso infiuencial a subscriber to her ownviews as America. In mnny respectsthe projected programme in further,nnce of the new policy comes betterfrom America than it would fromEngland, because the world ismistakenly led to believe thatEngland advocated disarmament,respect for treaties and peacefulsettlement of disputes principally sothat she may hold on to what shehas secured in the past, whereasAmerica. a young vigorous andwealthy nation, untrammeled by thecares of an Empire such u Englandhas to maintain and protect, can urgeco-operntion for peace and progresswithout the same suspicion of selfish.ness or ulterior motive as mightconceivably be ascribed to England.The address of Mr. Cordell Hull atthis particular moment was doubtlessdesigned both to serve as a warningand to allay anxiety in regard to thetense situation prevailing in centralEurope where the unusually elaboratemilitary manoeuvres of Germanyand the difficult problem of adiuttingsatisfactorily to both parties- thedifficulties between the Sudetens andthe Czechs, create an extremelydangerous situation where a singlespark might flare up into yet anotherwar. When diplomats talk theyinvsrisbiy leave a lot of thingsunsaid, nevertheless their auditoindearly perceive certain meaningswhich have been cleverly conveyed,though not expressed in set terms bythe diplomat, The speech of Mr.Cordell Hull in the same wayseemed to me to conveybeneath thepolitical phrases of diplomatic poll.renews a distinct threat to all nationsguilty of disturbing the peace thatthey would incur, not 0nly the displeasure of U.S.A. but the forCe ofher resentment in terms of definiteaction. Herr Hitler must have readthe address with serious searchingsof heart, and not Hitler alone,throughout world the warning conveyed by Mr. Cordell Hull musthave sounded the knell of theirparting day to other would-be disturbera of the peace. It is clear fromthe whole tenor of the speech thatAmerica is prepared actively topromote the rule of law betweennations and to co- operate effectivelywith other nations who signify theirwillingnen to support the samecause. America's next move, it issuggested, should be to call upon thenations to come out into the openwith a clear declaration as to whetheror not they are willing to align themselves with those nations who hadpledged themselves to uphold lawand order and treaty obligations.This would lead to a splendid renascence of the League of Nations oralternatively the creation of a worldcommission charged with the dutyof formulating a set of regulationsbest calculated to secure internationalpeace and justice. This will involverevision of treaties and of tariffs-aformidable task bristling with difficulties that cannot be surmounted in aday;, but these difficulties will disappear like a miK, dispersed by theWarm rays of restored confidenceand security between nations. TheAmerican Secretary of State by hisspeech has turned over a new pageof history and has offered a glorioueprospect that succeeding pages willbe full of hope arid happiness for thewhole world."}]}
