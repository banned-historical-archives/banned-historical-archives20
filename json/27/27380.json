By a strange coincidence, there came into my hands, yesterday,s remarkable book by the well.known Englishwriter, Mr. H. G. Wells. The book is entitled\"World Brain\", and propoaes a iolufion of theworld's present-day difficulties, so greatly superiorto my own humble effort, that I believe a shortsummary of his ideas may prove of interest toreaders of this journal. Briefly Mr. Wellsdescribes how knowledge has been squired by theworld in the past, namely, by schools, books,newspalers, the cinema, and the radio. Suchknowledge, he point out, h imperfect, insufficientand unreliable' because too often it is impartedto us by propagandists who seek to form ourjudgement from their own biassed viewpoint.In hh introduction he says, \"It is a very intereating thing indeed to ask oneself certain questions.How did I come to know that I know about theworld and myself? What ought t to know?What would I like to know that I don't know?If I want to know about this or that, where can Iget the clear, t, beat and latest information?And where did these other people about me gettheir ideas about things? Which are sometimesso different from mine? Why do we differ sowidely? Surely about a great number of thingsupon which we differ there is in existence' exactknowledge? So that we ought not to differ inthese things. This is true, not only about smallmatters in dispute, but about vitaUy importantthing concerning our business, our money, ourpolitical outlook, our health, the general,sonductof our lives. We are suessing, when we mithtknow. The facts are them, but we don't knowthem completely. We ara inadequately informed.We blunder about in our' ignorance, and thisgreat ruthless world in which we live, beatsupon us and punishes our ignorance like a sin.Not only in our ma#,mled democracies but inthe countries where dogmass and dictators rule,t:emendous decisions are constantly being madeaffecting human happlneis, root. and:branch, incomplete disregard of realities that are known.\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In the opinion of Mr: Wells we are not heist!told enough and we are not being told properlyour information is out of date, and many of themethodt of our economic life are not adjusted tothe new conditions created by modern scientificdiscoveries. His great scheme is that a WorldEncyclopaedia should be prepared by an organiised directorate, whoa, duO/it would be to receive.sort, summarize, and clarify essential knowledgeand ideas. The volumes of this Eneyclopaediawould not be final, they would be altered fromtime to time and kept up to date with inforrnationcollected from every university, every statisti~lbureau, every research institute and every scientificauthority. It would undergo continual revision;it might take the form of 20, or 30 or 40 volumesand it would go to libraries, schools, institutions,newspaper offices, ministries and so on all overthe.world. It would comtRute the beginning of areal World Brain, and would provide a powerfulinstrument to solve all the mighty diffculties ofour age."}]}
