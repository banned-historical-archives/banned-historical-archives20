M. Edwards."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Looking backward on the recent history of China.perhaps the strangest and most remarkable incident was the kidnapping of GeneralissimoChiang Kai-shek by Marshal Chang Hsue-liang. Thistook place just about two Years ago and was renderedpossible by the aid of the communist army but themost astonishing feature of the affair was the factthat the Generalissimo was released unharmed almostimmediately. There was a general sense of mysteryas to the manner in which the release had been con-.trived. and that veil of mystery has not been liftedyet, and probably will not be lifted during the lifetimeof the Generalissimo. Nevertheless it is possible tohazard a very shrewd guess as to the reason whyGeneralissimo Chiang Kai-shek w. permitted to regain his freedom. It wi11 be recaled that at the timethe Communist prmy were resolved to fight Japan andconsidered that the Geineralissiiro was not taking asfrm a stand as he would. against Japanese encroachments. On the other had the majority of foreigncritics were of opinion that the Generalissimo wasadopting the wise and in fact the only practiced policyof staving off war with Japan as long as possible so asto gain time in which to stren then China's militaryresources. Fenring these facts in mind it is extremely probable that the main condition on whichthe Generalissimo was restored to liberty was hispromise to fight when next the Japanese invadedChinese territory. The probable accuracy of this surprise is born out by the resolute manner in which theGeneralissimo opposed the Japanese demand is following the incidents of July 1937, and also by the loyalsupport which the Communist armies have continuously accorded to him. What the Generalissimo hasdone to unite the chinese provinces into a solid bleckof national resistance, what he has achieved in theway of defence against armies highly mechanized andtherefore grreatly superior in fighting strength to hisown forces, I leave to history to procliaim and, Iventure to predict that history will emphaticallypraise the prowess of China's leader in her hour ofdenger.　It is then with a sense of shock and surprisethat one reads in the newspapers Mr. Eugene Chen'sopinion that the first condition of Chinese victory isa strengthened leadership to be effected by the transformation of the existing oneman party leadershipinto a national group-leadership consisting of GeneralChiang Kai-shek himself and two to four of the fittestmen among his fellow countrymen who as a wargovernment will exercise the supreme power nowwieldedI by the Generil alone.\" In the course of hisargument for a change Mr. Chen quotes the exampleof Marshal Foch who was charged with the supremecommand over all the allied generals in the GreatWar. This unified command was an unqualfied suceess and was brought about because the Alliesrealized in time that three or four generals with equalcommand could never agree and cooperate wholehearteily on a plan of campaign. The wisdom ofunified command was applaudedd by the whole worldand to suggest the adoption of a divided control inChina is to invite disagreement among the junta ofadvisers and grave danger of chaos. Such a coursewould be justiciable only if Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek was considered to be a failure, which is far frombeing the prevailing opinion, and that no other singlemiiti could be found to take over his position. Thegood sense of the Chinese people will undoubtedlydisincline the, \"to swap horses when crossing thestream.\""}]}
