Two thousand years ago theJews flourished as a wealthy and powerful nation inNorthern Africa.

For the past 1900 yearsthey have been wanderers upon the face of the Earth.without a country of their own and without a Government of their own. Nevertheless the Jews have nevellost their identity and this remarkable fact is due tothe steadfast devotion to their religion which theyhave maintained in spite of all their afflictions. Theyhave therefore a two-fold aspect (1) as a race withou'a state, (2) as a religion which still survives. Thisreligion is based OB the laws which the prophet, Mosesgave to them' these laws impose rules of life and rule.regarding health and focd. These rules, tu which, as arace they have strictly adhered have set them aparlfrom the rest of the world and are mainly responsiblefor the persecution to which they have been subjectePeople with peculiar habits are seldom popular alin the case of the Jews their peculiarities havcaused suspicion--enerally unjustified, and havthus brou ht trouble upon them. It cannot be dispnted that the Jews possess many sterling qualitiesIn the upholdlng of family life no nation ia superiolto them--n regard to the sanctity of marriage, respeclto parents--are and devotion to their children, thehave always maintained a very high standard. Theircode of morals and ethics is also beyond reproach.With these high qualitie s it is surprising that so muchopposition should have been offered to them. In theMiddle Ages the scattered Jews were mostly to befound on the continent of Europe, in Germany, Polancand Russia but in these early days religious prejudicewas rife aad those whose religious convictions differefrom the prevailing orthodox belief were oppresseheavily and sufered many disabihties. For example,no Jew was permitted to own land or to bold any position la the sarvice ef the Government This exclusionfrom the ownerahip of land prevented the Jews frombecoming agriculturists and they turned their attention to trade, in which they exhibited great industryand conspicuous ability.
