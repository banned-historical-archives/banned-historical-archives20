M.

Both ideas are wrong, the English fighting spirit is as strong as ever and England so far from being mad is wisely and calmly following a farsighted policy in European affairs as she has always done and no one can deny, with considerable success hitherto. The truth of the matter is that during the crisis last September England suddenly discovered that Germany possessed an Air Force of 10,000 planes which was more than double the number of planes possessed by En?and and France combined. Worse still Germany was turning out new planes more rapidly than England and France together. At that time Germony was in a position to send 50 bombing planes over London every hour for 24 hours. Proof of the damage that these bombs could inflict had been given in Spain where eight of her newest bombs were dropped. Each bomb killed every one within one eighth of a mile from the place where it fell and many were injured who were a quarter of a mile away. England faced with wholesale destruction ef her capital city, played for time. But how had Germany contrived to obtain this supremacy in the air? By secret factories in Germany and by secret armament work Even so, in my opinion England was guilty of negligence in failing to discover the immense and dangerous preparations that Germany had been so actively making. For this neglect the English GoVernment should be/held responsible and in spite of the adroit way in which Mr. Chamberlain saved his country from a major disaster--he ought, in my opinion to resign for having bronght England to the brink of ruin by his carelessness. France is, of course equally to blame but in this article I am discussing England's actions only and her reasons for them. Itwill take England and France more than a year to catch up with Germany ia fighting Planes and in this calculation I am leaving Italy out of the picture altogether. Nevertheless the situation today is not nearly so serious as it seems because England has the finest anti-aircraft guns inthe world. In September 1938 she had very few otthese guns but by working day and night she has nowan ample supply. London's air defence today consists of a comlplete ring of air-balloons all round /hecity. These are Suspended sufficiently high in tho ai,to be beyond the reach of any sound from the groun,but, poised in the atmosphere, they act as listenersand can give timely warning of the approach of acreplanes whilst the latter are still hundreds of mile:,distant from the city. As soon as warning of enemyplanes is received anti-aircraft guns will project intothe sky to a height of seven miles a rain of bullets inalldirections through which it would be almost impossible for a single plane to pass without beingdestr0yed. If Mr. Hitler at the present time sendshis air-fleet to London, few if any of the planes whichcomplete the journey will ever return to Germany andthe millions of pounds he has squandered on his airforce will be disgipated in the air. and I believe thatMr. Hitler is shrewd enough to realize .this and refrainfrom making so fatal an attempt. Possibly this is thereason why Mussolini usedsuch unusual moderationin his recent speech, for Germany and Italy are wellaware that Efigland is the great obstacle to theirambitions and that to succeed they must deliver sucha smashing blow as to knock her out of the fight inthe early stages. This hops has now been shatteredby the efficiency of England's air-defence. In a longwar England's vastly superior naval :strength mustinevitably 'turn the scale inher favour as it did in theGreat War when her supremacy was much less markedthat it is today. Recent history indicates that airpower cannot win a war though it may'do a lot ofdamage, and again nothing in recent history hasappeared to disprove the tremendous power of thebattleship as the mightiest factor for securing finalvictory. Those people therefore who believe that theBritish lion is suffering from senile decay may have arude awakening. That his tail has been wistod Iadmit, but that has been a popu]ar pastime for centuries and is caused by hiswagging it in'to0 friendlya fashion but if and when the lon is roused his clawsusually ca/use s painful impression on the enemy whoroused hyn and history has a strange way of repeat ing itself"}]}
