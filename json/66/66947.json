This settlementholds good for one year only and has not disposedfinally of the matters in dispute. It has ,however,established the fact,which we have consistentlymaintained that neither Soviet Russia onr Japanwished at the present time to incur the risk of warwith each other.This settlement coupled with theuncertain conditions in Europe makes it clear thatChina will have to continue her struggle against Japanwithout hope of any military assistance from anyforeign power.This entails a heavy sacrifice onChina's part but ultimately she will reap a rich reward because the preservation of her sovereinty and independence,unaided,will gain for at least thirtyyears during which period she will be able to establishthe Republic on a permanent and secure basis.Thenest six months will mark a critical stage in thehostilities.The strategy of trading space of time,ofavoiding major battles but stubbornly successful.ourable positions as long as possible and then makingan orderly retreat,has been magniecently successful.Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is now changing hisstrategy and is about to attack the enemy in variousselected sectors.By so doing he has once againshown great wisdom and comsummate skill as a general. How will the Japanese soldiers react to thischallenge to their invincibility? The morale of theJapanese troops is admittedly good but it will beseverely tested in the next few months.Instead ofHankow and Canton they will be subjected to seriousonslaughts at points not as hitherto selected by themselves but by their enemies and in addition to thesemajor engagements their garrison in the occupiedterritory will be continuously harassed by guerillaforces.When an army has been told that it is unbeatable and that it will bring its enemies to theirknees in a few montlrs ,it is full of confidence and martial spirit,but when two years later the enemy sofar from being beaten to ist knees is counter attacking,then doubts begin to arise and from doubts questions.How long is the war going to last and whyare we going backwards instead of forwards? Unquestionably the Japanese Generals will have anunenviable task to convince their troops of ultimatevictory.And what of the people at home in Japan?"}]}
