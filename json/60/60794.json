At the present time there are fifteendemocratic countries and undoubtedly world peacewould speedily be brought about if they all consentedto unite. Under Mr. Streit's scheme each countrywould preserve its own laws and customs and onlyforeign affairs and questions of defence would be dealtwith by the common government. The proposal is anattractive one and well worth serious considerationbecause it seems to be more definite and practicalthan the League of Nations. In the League of Nationswhere the member States represent such differentpolitical ideas as monarchical systems and communistic republics it is not surprising that agreementin joint action is extremely difficult to secure. In theproposed Union of Democracies far greater unanimitymight be expected because all the countries withinthe union would all be actuated by the same democratic principles. That States are able to unite successfully is proved by the case of the United Statesof America and on a smaller scale even here InShanghai we have seen an international Administration working smoothly for many years. Whilst it istrue that a Union of Democracies would be so powerfulthat no other combination of nation could possiblystand against it, it is nevertheless equally true thatthere are certain reasons for doubting whether itwould succeed at the present time. To begin with, isthe world ready for it? It would be ft big stride forward for civilization but civilization just now seemsto be dropping backwards rather than progressing.The failure of the League of Nations and the nationalanimosities, greed and selfishness that prevail, allshow a lack of justice and balance that might easilydeprive the Union of its usefulness and value. Again,could the Union be trusted, to use its enormous powerfairly and honestly or would it oppress the othernations and thus keep alive the grievances and injustice which have caused the unsettled condition ofthe world to-day. Past history shows as that it isuseless for a country to pass good laws unless thepeople of the country are ready for such laws andwilling to obev them: too often it has happened thatthe people have refused to observe a new law and ithas had to be dropped. In other words the peoplemust be sufficiently enlightened and educated toappreciate the value of the new legislation. Atpresent the stage of enlightenment and education ofthe nations does not appear to be sufficiently advanced to hold out hopes that a Democratic Unionwould function justly and properly, and yet it maywell be that the nations are sounl at heart but lackstrong and capable leadership. The Union outlinedby Mr. Streit may never come into existence but it iscertain that in time, probably within the next fiftyvears, all the nations will join a World State to poolresources, to share advantages and to check the ambitions of aggressive nations whose misguided patri'-.tism would, otherwise, plunge their countries intothe horrors of war. When that day arrives the millions of pounds now squandered wastefully on armaments will be devoted to improving the conditions oflife for the people and then an era of universal peaceand prosperity will be unhered in."}]}
