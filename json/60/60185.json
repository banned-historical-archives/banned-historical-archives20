Forthis reason a brief description of the manner in whicha new Pope　is, elected may be of interest. especially at the present time when　an election is actually in progress as a result of the death of Pope Pius XI. Thesolemn duty　of choosing who shall be the next Popedevolves upon the Cardinals who are commonly knownas the Princes of the Church. In normal times theirtask is to advise and assist the Pope in his onerousduties. The　procedure adopted for the selection of aPope is as follows: the Cardinals meet in a wing of thePalace of the Vatican and here they are locked in andnot allowed to come out until the election has beenduly completed.　This meeting is known as a Conclaveor locking in, and in addition to the Cardinals, theirprivate secretaries and servants are also cut off fromthe outside world until the new Pope has been elected.Within the Conclave each Cardinal h:as two rooms,one　for himself and　one for his attendants. TheCardinals are obliged to dine alone and they are servedwith three meals a day. The food for these meals ispassed through a wicket in the door of entrance to theConclave.　The Cardinals enter the Conclave on theday after the funeral of the late Pope and once theyare inside they　immediately proceed to lock themselves in. Outside the Conclave, however, there is anadditional key held by the Marshal of the Conclave,it is his dnty to see that no one emerges from theConclave　but he must　open the door to admit anycardinal who because of illness or because he has hadto travel from a far country has arrived late for theelection. There are three ways by which a Pope maybe elected, (1) by acclamation that is to say that iftwo thirds of all the Cardinals present at once proclaimtheir choice of the same man that man is immediatelydeclared to be the Pope without the necessity of proceeding to a ballot. (2) By compromise: if the Cardinals are unable to agree upon the choice of the newPope they may nominate one or more members of theirbody　to name　who shall be Pope, or (S) by ballot.This is the usual method adopted and it is carried outin the Paolina Chapel which is a small church attachedto the Conclave. Here the Cardinals meet twice dailyfor the purpose of recording their votes and the votingis carried out in the following manner. Each Cardinal writes the name of the candidate whom he recommends　upon a voting ticket: he then kneels before thealtar of the chapel and says a short prayer and alsotakes an oath that he is giving his vote to the manwho, according to God ought to be elected Pope. Whenbe has taken the oath be places the voting ticket in asilver chalice which reposes on the altar. As soon asall the votes have been recorded three scrutineers,who　are chosen daily by lot among　the Cardinalscarry the chalice to the middle of the Chapel and pourout the voting tickets from the chalice onto a table.The first scrutineer then takes a ticket, opens it andhands it to the second scrutineer who reads it andthen passes it on to the third scrutineer. The thirdscrutineer proclaims in a loud voice the name writtenon each ticket as it is handed to him and the Cardinalswho are all seated in their places keep a careful noteof the score of　votes secured by each Cardinal. Thenumber　of　votes scored by each Cardinal is thencounted and if any candidate has obtained the necessary majority of two-thirds of all the votes he is atonce declared to be the Pope. If however as generallyhappens, no Cardinal has secured a two-thirds majority on the first ballot a second ballot is carried out inthe same manner　and in this ballot the Cardinals areinvited to vote for a different candidate from the onethey voted for in the first ballot. The votes recordedin this second ballot are added to the votes obtainedin the first ballot　and they usually result in producingthe required two-thirds majority but if they fail to doso, recourse is then had to the election by compromisewhich has been described above as the second way ofelecting a Pope. When finally the new Pope has beenelected the Cardinals all move backwards before himand fall upon their knees. The senior Cardinal thenapproaches and asks him if he is willing to accept theoffice of Pope. At this solemn　moment　 it oftenhappens　that the new　Pope　desires to decline thedignity either through humility or because he considers himself unworthy of the high honour conferredupon　him but usually the Cardinals succeed in persuading him　to accept the position. When　he hasgiven his consent he is immediately conducted to therear of the altar where the Pontifical robes are allspread　out in readiness*　in these he is forthwithinvested together with the white shoes on which across of gold has been embroidered. He is next placedin the chair of Saint Peter, the first Pope, and theFisherman's　ring is placed upon his finger. ThisFisherman's ring is so called because the first Pope,Peter, was a fisherman whom Jesus Christ called awayfrom the sea, saying to him \"henceforth you shall fishfor men.\"　When　the Cardinals have all paid homageto the new　Pope the Dean of the Cardinals proceedsto the balcony of　Saint Peter's Cathedral and announces the name　of the new Pope to the assembledmultitude.　This is followed by a joyous ringing of allthe church bells in Rome and the guns at Castle St.Angelo　are fired as a salute. Thereupon the Popehimself appears on the　balcony surrounded by theCardinals and the papal guards in their magnificentuniforms　and solemnly　raising his right hand hebestows　his first blessing upon the thousands ofChristians below. The　spiritual leader is thus installed to govern the fortunes of Catholic Christendomthroughout the world."}]}
