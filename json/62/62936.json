Withthe advent of the Chinese Republic in the year 1911the chains by which women were lettered havegradually been broken,one by one and their progresstowards more complete freedom has been still moregreatly accelerated as a result of the present war.The endurance and fortitude of women have beenseverely tested by the eventful days of the past twoyears and nobly they have born the strain. Drivenfrom their homes,sometimes more than once, bombedfrom the air,relations and friends killed in battle,they have carried on bravely in spite of all thesedisasters. Not content to suffer patiently the hardships forced upon them, they have left the shelter oftheir homes in thousands and taken their placesalongside their men-fork in difficulties and dangers.Caring for the sick and wounded in the hospitals andin the open they have rendered signal service to theircountry.In many other ways they have also givengreat help to the government by making warm garments and providing other comforts for the fightingforces.They have assisted continuously in the workof education,often at great personal risk and havedone much to furnish entertainments and amusements for the soldiers at the front.If all the instances of individual heroism by Chinese women couldbe collected together and proclaimed it would be amagnificent record of courageous achievement. In allparts of this afflicted country women are to be foundplaying everywhere an active and useful part. Beforethe war who could have dreamt that the women ofChina were capable of showing such admirable independence? These heroic deeds should not be forgottenand when peace is concluded women should be granteda greater share in national affairs and wider opportunities of work and service. To this they are rightfully entitled though many men will disagree andstrongly oppose any advance in the direction of theemancipation of women. In England and Americawhere women enjoy greater independence than in anyother country, the men stoutly opposed the efforts ofwomen to arrive at sex equality. But were theyjustified in so doing? Old-fashioned people are firmin their belief that the right place for women is in thehome caring for their children and theirhusbands and unquestionably this is then principalmission in life and cannot be neglected without injuryto the State. There are, however other considerations. Wherever the dignity, honour and reasonableindependence of women are found, there also will befound the greatest advance in civilization whilst onthe contrary in those countries where the conditionof women is little better than domestic slavery,civilization is unable to make satisfactory progress.Men take after their mothers, if you study history youwill find that it is almost unknown for a famousfather to have a famous son. but in the case of nearlyevery famous man you will find that he had an exceptional mother. The status of women in Germanyis lower than in any other country in Europe and thisfact, in the opinion of many observers, is the reasonwhy German men are so willing to follow slavishlyany leader, no matter how extreme his policy may be.Blindly and fatally they were led by the Kaiser intothe desperate adventure of the Great War and similary they may be led again by the Reichs FuehrerAdolf Hitler. Inevitably the lack of independence inGerman mothers has been reproduced in the sons. Inthe everyday affairs of life women are more practicalthan man and in those countries where they havemore power they exert a great influence to reducegambling and to prevent war. It must be admittedtherefore that a strong case may be made out forgiving women a larger share in national affairs. Inmatters of public order, health and welfare they haveshown their value and usefulness and with rare exceptions they have proved more bonest in their performance of public duties than men. The foregoing factshave been amply demone teated in England and America and there is no reason to suppose thatany different result will follow from giving thewomen of China their rightful position. Dailythe noble women of this country are affording usexamples of heroism and service, and recognitionof their efforts can be given in no better waythan by granting them a wider participation inpublic affairs, and this well-neited reward willnot only increase the interest and happiness ofthe lives of women but will also result in lastingbenefit to China."}]}
