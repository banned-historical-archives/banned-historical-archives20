In anycase money is one of the great troubles of life: it is aworry if he have not got it and if we have got it, it isa worry to know how to keep it and how to spend it.More than half of the most serious crimes are committeed for its sake, robbery swindling and evenmurder. And yet we all wish to have it. The truthof the matter is that the possession of money is valuedfar more highly than it ought to be and is given muchgreater importance than it deserves. Many peopleimagine that millionaires are the happiest people onearth, but it is not so. As a rule the millionaire livesin constant fear of losing bis money, he suspectseveryone who comes near him of trying to get some ofbis money away from him and in this he is generallyright. The possession of great wealth is a tremendousanxiety; it is so difficult to know what to do with alot of money: how to invest it safely, in what way touse it? In times of financial crisis or of war themillionarire finds his money much more of a worrythan a pleasure. If the rich have their worries overmoney you may be sure the poor have far greaterworry, for them it is an unceasing struggle to obtainsufficient money to provide themselves with food andclothing. To be in desperate need of money is aheavy trial yet many a poor man is in this sad position for the greater part if not for the whole of hislife. Much of the misery caused by money might beavoided if people were wise enough and careful enoughin their spending of it and especially in their savingof it. It is surprising that instruction in wise spending and in thrift is not given in the schools sinceignorance of the care of money causes so much unhappiness in the world. In some countries schoolchildren are encouraged to save money and the resultshave been highly successfulæ¢žany students acquiring the habit of \"saving something for a rainy day\"which has proved a lasting comfort and benefit forthe rest of their lives. How to use money honestly,wisely and profitably is a subject about which mostpeople know very little and when one realizes theimportant part which money plays in one's life it isregrettable that more enlightenment on the subjectis not forthcoming from political economists. Perhapsthe worst feature about money is the fawning andservile respect which is paid to the possessors ofwealth: this is definitely harmful to the wealthy possessor and to the slavish admirer and is responsiblefor a great of the ignorance and misunderstandingwhich exists as to the value of money. The possession of money is no guarantee of success or happiness:a healthy poor man is far happier than a rich roanwho has ruined his health by the overindulgence whichmoney has tempted him to practise. We are forcedto the conclusion that we should not see too great avalue on money. Unquestionably the happiest peopleare those who have just enough money on which tolive, with perhaps a little money saved for an emergency. Unlike the rich their appetites have neverbecome jaded and blunted and they savour to the fullthe enjoyments which their modest incomes bring tothem only rarely and in small doses. Moderate meanstherefore are more likely to bring contentment thanimmense wealth, another example of the blousednessof \"the Middle Way\" recommended by Conful is."}]}
